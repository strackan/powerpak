# TEST EXAMPLE
## How to Use the Writing Engine

**Scenario:** Justin says "Write a LinkedIn post about Renubu's launch"

---

## STEP 1: Assess (AI does this automatically)

**Content type:** Product announcement  
**Audience:** CS professionals + founders  
**Goal:** Awareness + relationship building  
**Justin's current energy:** Energized (from CURRENT_STATE.md)

---

## STEP 2: Check Variety (AI reads RECENT_POSTS_LOG.md)

Last 3 posts used:
- Vulnerability opener
- Pattern recognition opener  
- Scene-setting opener

**Decision:** Don't use vulnerability again. Try something fresh.

---

## STEP 3: Select Blend

**From BLEND_RECIPES.md:**
Pattern Spotter works well for product launches to broad audience

**Components:**
- O4: Pattern Recognition opener
- M2: Philosophical middle  
- E1: Open question ending
- F3: Parenthetical asides throughout
- F5: Strategic profanity for rhythm

---

## STEP 4: Write

```
Three things happened this year that seemed unrelated:

First, I got laid off from SecureLink after 18 years. Employee #1, three exits, Chief Customer Officer. Gone.

Second, I watched my CS friends burning out. Not because they were bad at their jobs - because their jobs had become inhuman. Managing 200+ relationships while juggling renewals, expansions, upsells, and somehow still being "strategic partners" to their customers. The cognitive load was fucking unsustainable.

Third, I started building in public. Not because I had it figured out, but because I didn't. Every founder pretends they have the master plan. I just had a crowded brain and a lot of questions.

Here's what I didn't see coming: Those three things were actually the same thing.

They were all about this: How do you take overwhelming complexity and distill it down to one clear next step? How do you translate chaos into "just do this"?

For 18 years, I'd been doing that for customers. Now I needed it for myself. And I realized - every CSM I know needs it too.

That's Renubu.

Not another dashboard. Not more data. Not AI that generates generic emails nobody reads.

It's the system that understands you're drowning, asks the right questions, and tells you: "Do. This. Next."

We just launched publicly this week. (Terrifying, honestly.) We're working with our first design partners to build the thing I wish I'd had when I was managing 500+ accounts and trying to remember which customers were at risk, which were ready to expand, and what the hell I should be working on first.

Early days. Still figuring it out. But the vision is clear: Make work joyful again.

Does this resonate?

## STEP 5: Present to Justin

**AI says:**

"Does this land right?"

---

## STEP 6: Justin Responds

**Option A:** "Perfect, ship it"  
→ Update RECENT_POSTS_LOG.md (Pattern Recognition + Philosophical)  
→ Update BLEND_RECIPES.md (note performance when known)

**Option B:** "Too heavy"  
→ AI: "Want it more punchy/lighter?"  
→ Justin: "Yeah, more energy"  
→ AI: Rewrite with O5 (Provocative) instead

**Option C:** "This is great but change the ending"  
→ AI: Make specific edit, present again

---

## WHAT JUSTIN NEVER HAS TO DO

❌ Remember which template to use  
❌ Know that O4+M2+E1 is "Pattern Spotter"  
❌ Check if he used this opener recently  
❌ Match components to his energy  
❌ Explain what he wants (just react to draft)

---

## WHAT AI TRACKS AUTOMATICALLY

✅ Recent post history (variety)  
✅ Energy mode (from CURRENT_STATE.md)  
✅ What blends work best (BLEND_RECIPES.md)  
✅ Feedback patterns (LEARNING_LOG.md)  
✅ Component effectiveness over time

---

**This is how the system works. Justin just writes. AI handles the rest.**

# EXAMPLE #10: REAL SYSTEM OUTPUT
## Hiring Post (95% AI, 5% Justin Polish)

**Scenario:** Justin asks AI to write about hiring philosophy

---

## WHAT THE SYSTEM DID

**Assessed:**
- Content type: Thought leadership / company culture
- Audience: Potential hires + industry peers
- Goal: Positioning + entertainment
- Energy: Playful, contrarian (from CURRENT_STATE.md)

**Selected Components:**
- O5: Provocative Question (implied: "how should we hire?")
- M2: Philosophical Escalation (force multipliers, ARR/FTE)
- F7: **ABSURDIST RABBIT HOLE** (Kafka tangent)
- F8: **SPACING AS PACING** (visual rhythm)
- F10: **THE TRICKSTER** (rug-pull: "If we were hiring. Which we're not.")
- E4: Unexpected Twist (rocket ship → ninja)

---

## THE OUTPUT

```
Here's how we're hiring at Renubu (clarification that feels important -- we're not hiring at Renubu)

Rule #1: We only hire generalists.
.
"Oh sure, I get it -- your background is leading marketing teams."
"Absolutely, I see you've spent ten years managing internal IT systems."
"No no, totally understand -- you've been CFO at three Series A companies."

Great. That's your core expertise. That's why I want you building AI-orchestrated systems in your domain. You'll create world-class stuff because you actually understand the problems.

But here's the thing:

if the company has a content problem?
An engineering problem?
Data analysis challenge?

You've got access to the entire corpus of human knowledge! You're telling me you can't write an email? Analyze a dataset? Build a react component? Yes, you can. Pull up a chair.

Everyone is a generalist. Everyone augments to fit the need of the team. If you can't refit yourself into whatever shape the moment requires, you're not a force multiplier. And we don't have space for that.

If we were hiring.

Which we're not.

Rule #2: Our North Star metric is not ARR. It's ARR / FTE (my goal is $1M).

(I get that the standard benchmark is $100k - $300k. These are trailing metrics. With the proper AI orchestration strategies, I'm not sure why I would need >5 FTEs to manage $5M ARR. Sorry, I don't)

I don't want to hire. I want force multipliers who make hiring unnecessary.

Unless you have like, **really** good taste in music.

Rule #3: Software jobs are golden tickets.

Our motto as of pretty recently?

"Make Work Joyful."

If you a) work at Renubu, b) can leverage AI-orchestrated thinking to match our execution speed, and handle our absurdist way (actually, interesting story -- Franz Kafka spent his entire life working a soul-crushing job at an insurance company, writing at night about people trapped in meaningless bureaucratic nightmares, and when he was dying he begged his best friend Max Brod to burn all his manuscripts, every single one, "Please, burn it all," and Max looked him in the eye and said yes, then Kafka died and Max immediately published everything, every word, turned Kafka into one of the most famous writers in history, so now millions of people read Kafka's stories about being trapped in systems you can't escape and nobody -- NOBODY -- talks about the fact that Kafka literally tried to escape the system of his own legacy and failed, the guy who wrote "The Trial" couldn't even win his own trial against posterity, if that's not absurd I don't know what is? Sorry who are you again?) of seeing the world, I will make it my mission to ensure you going to have the best work experience of your life.

This is the new playbook for founder-led sales.

We're not building a stupid goddamn rocket ship.

No one wants to be a stupid rocket ship anymore for Halloween.

But you know what they do want to be?

A motherfucking ninja.

## COMPONENT BREAKDOWN

### **F7: ABSURDIST RABBIT HOLE** ← The Star
- Gateway word: "absurdist"
- Triggered 200+ word Kafka tangent
- Dark/ironic punch: "couldn't even win his own trial against posterity"
- Callback: "(Sorry who are you again?)"
- **Dominates the section** -- tangent IS the post

### **F8: SPACING AS PACING**
- Single line breaks for rapid fire questions:
  ```
  if the company has a content problem?
  An engineering problem?
  Data analysis challenge?
  ```
- Double spaces between rules (breathing room)
- Long Kafka paragraph = visual "story time" signal
- Reader sees rhythm before reading

### **F10: THE TRICKSTER**
- Opens serious: "Here's how we're hiring"
- Rug-pull #1: "(we're not hiring at Renubu)"
- Maintains serious tone through Rules 1-3
- Rug-pull #2: "If we were hiring. Which we're not."
- Final twist: rocket ship → ninja punchline
- Reader never knows when joke is coming

### **F9: VULNERABILITY BOUNDARY**
- "(I get that the standard benchmark is $100k - $300k...)"
- Alludes to knowing this is bold
- Never admits fear in the moment
- False confidence with self-aware parentheticals

### **F3: PARENTHETICALS** (Throughout)
- "(clarification that feels important -- we're not hiring)"
- "(I get that the standard benchmark...)"
- "(Sorry, I don't)"
- "(actually, interesting story --"
- "(Sorry who are you again?)"

### **F5: STRATEGIC PROFANITY**
- "stupid goddamn rocket ship"
- "motherfucking ninja"
- Used for rhythm and emphasis, not gratuitously

### **Double Hyphens Throughout** ✅
- "-- we're not hiring"
- "-- Franz Kafka"
- "-- NOBODY"
- No em dashes (AI tell avoided)

---

## JUSTIN'S EDITS (5%)
