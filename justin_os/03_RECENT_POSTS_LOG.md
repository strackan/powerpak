## VARIETY RULES

**Don't repeat:**
- Same opening 2x in a row
- Same blend 3x in 10 posts
- Same energy 4x in a row

**Do rotate:**
- All 6 opener types within 15 posts
- All 7 middle types within 20 posts
- All 6 ending types within 15 posts

**Perplexity target:** ~0.7
(Predictably Justin, but not boringly repetitive)
