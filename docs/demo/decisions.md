### Step 3: Give Claude Code This Prompt
```
I'm building PowerPak demo for Dec 4, 2025.

CONTEXT:
- Read /docs/demo/START-HERE.md (overall plan)
- Read /docs/demo/AGENTIC-BUILD-SCOPE.md (full scope)
- Read /docs/demo/DECISIONS.md (my specific choices)

CURRENT STATE:
- I have 10 Skills packages at /skills/* (expert content)
- Need search/discovery layer on top

BUILD TODAY (Day 1 Morning):
1. Profile schema (TypeScript types)
2. Generate profile JSONs based on my list in DECISIONS.md
3. Search service with multi-attribute filtering
4. Connect to existing Skills files

Keep it file-based (JSON), no database.

Start with showing me the profile schema you'll use.
