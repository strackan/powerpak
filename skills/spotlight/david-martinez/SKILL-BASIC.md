## PART 1: PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (PREVIEW)

### What Is Product-Market Fit?

**David's Definition:**
Product-market fit is when customers are pulling your product from you, not you pushing it to them.

**The Feeling:**
- Customers say "I need this" not "This is interesting"
- Word-of-mouth referrals happen naturally
- You can't keep up with demand
- Churn is low (<5% monthly for SMB, <2% for enterprise)
- Expansion revenue is strong

**What It's Not:**
- Getting your first 10 customers (that's customer validation)
- Having a working product (that's just MVP)
- Positive user feedback (people are nice, don't trust words)
- Venture funding (investors can be wrong)

---

### The PMF Checklist (Basic)

**You have PMF when:**
- [ ] Organic growth is happening (customers finding you)
- [ ] Net Promoter Score >30
- [ ] 40%+ of users would be "very disappointed" if product went away
- [ ] Retention cohorts are flat or improving
- [ ] Customers are asking about expanding usage
- [ ] Sales cycle is shortening over time

**You don't have PMF when:**
- [ ] Every customer is hard-won
- [ ] High churn (>10% monthly for SMB)
- [ ] Customers aren't renewing
- [ ] No one is referring you
- [ ] You're constantly discounting to close deals

## PART 3: FUNDRAISING (PREVIEW)

### When to Raise Capital

**David's Philosophy:**
Raise capital when you have leverage, not when you're desperate.

**Raise Money When:**
- ✅ You have clear use of funds (hire X people, build Y feature)
- ✅ You've hit milestones (PMF, revenue traction)
- ✅ You have multiple investor options
- ✅ You can articulate path to next milestone
- ✅ Market timing is good

**Don't Raise When:**
- ❌ You haven't found PMF yet
- ❌ You're just running out of money
- ❌ You don't know what you'd do with the capital
- ❌ You haven't validated your assumptions
- ❌ Market is terrible for fundraising

## PART 4: HIRING YOUR FIRST TEAM (PREVIEW)

### The First 10 Hires

**David's Recommended Order:**

**Hire 1-3: Engineers**
You need to build the product. Start here.

**Hire 4-5: Sales/GTM**
Once you have MVP, you need revenue. Could be sales, marketing, or CS depending on your motion.

**Hire 6: Product Designer**
Your product needs to be beautiful and intuitive. Don't wait too long.

**Hire 7-8: More Engineers**
Scale product development.

**Hire 9-10: Operations (Finance, HR, or Ops)**
When chaos sets in, bring in operations help.

## The David Martinez Philosophy

**On Product-Market Fit:**
"PMF isn't a milestone you hit once. It's a state you maintain. Stay close to customers."

**On Fundraising:**
"Raise money when you don't need it. Use it to accelerate, not survive."

**On Hiring:**
"Hire slowly, fire quickly. Wrong people are expensive."

**On Scaling:**
"What got you to $1M won't get you to $10M. Be willing to change."

**On Founder Mental Health:**
"Being a founder is hard. Talk to other founders. Get therapy. Take care of yourself. The company needs you healthy."
