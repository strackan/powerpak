## PART 1: PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (FULL)

### The PMF Journey

**How David Found PMF (Twice):**

**DataPipe Story:**
- Started building marketing dashboards (wrong)
- Talked to 50 marketers, found they wanted attribution (pivot #1)
- Built multi-touch attribution tool
- Customers said "nice but not critical" (not PMF yet)
- Discovered they really wanted to understand CAC by channel
- Rebuilt around CAC optimization (pivot #2)
- Customers started saying "I need this yesterday" (PMF!)
- Took 14 months to find PMF

**SaleSync Story:**
- Knew from DataPipe experience: talk to customers BEFORE building
- Talked to 100 sales leaders before writing code
- Found pattern: sales teams drowning in manual data entry
- Built sales automation focused on eliminating busy work
- First 10 customers had 90%+ retention (PMF signal)
- Took 6 months to find PMF (learned from first time)

---

### The Customer Discovery Framework

**Phase 1: Problem Discovery (2-4 weeks)**

**Goal:** Understand if the problem you want to solve actually exists and is painful enough.

**Activities:**
- Interview 20-30 potential customers
- Focus on problems, not solutions
- Understand current workflows
- Identify pain points and costs
- Map competitive alternatives

**David's Interview Script:**

"Hi [Name], I'm researching [problem area] and would love to learn from your experience. I'm not selling anything - genuinely trying to understand the space.

Can you walk me through how you currently [do X task]?
[Let them talk for 5-10 minutes. Take notes.]

What's the most frustrating part of that process?
[Listen for real pain, not polite complaints]

How much time does this take you per week/month?
[Quantify the problem]

What have you tried to solve this?
[See what alternatives exist]

If someone could wave a magic wand and fix this perfectly, what would that look like?
[Understand ideal outcome]

How much would you pay to solve this problem?
[Validate willingness to pay]

Thank you. Can I follow up with you as I learn more?
[Build relationship for later]"

**Success Criteria:**
- 70%+ of people confirm the problem exists
- They're currently spending significant time/money on it
- Their workarounds are painful or expensive
- They'd pay to solve it

**If you hit these criteria:** Move to Phase 2
**If you don't:** Change target customer or problem space

---

**Phase 2: Solution Validation (4-8 weeks)**

**Goal:** Validate that your proposed solution would solve the problem.

**Activities:**
- Create mockups/prototypes (NOT full product)
- Show to 15-20 prospects from Phase 1
- Walk through proposed solution
- Get specific feedback
- Pre-sell if possible

**David's Validation Questions:**

"Based on our last conversation, here's what I've been working on. [Show mockup]

Walk me through how you'd use this...
[Watch them interact, note confusion]

Would this solve the problem you described?
[Yes/no/partially?]

What's missing that would make this a must-have?
[Identify gaps]

On a scale of 1-10, how likely would you be to buy this?
[9-10 = good, <9 = dig deeper]

If I could get this ready in 60 days, would you be willing to be a beta customer?
[Test real commitment]

Would you pay for early access?
[Ultimate validation]"

**Success Criteria:**
- 50%+ say they'd definitely use it (9-10 score)
- Clear value proposition emerges
- 5-10 people commit to being beta customers
- 3-5 people will pay for early access

---

**Phase 3: MVP Build & Launch (8-16 weeks)**

**Goal:** Build minimum version that delivers core value.

**David's MVP Philosophy:**
"Your MVP should be embarrassingly minimal. If you're not embarrassed by v1, you waited too long to ship."

**What to Include:**
- Core workflow that solves the main problem
- Minimum features needed to deliver value
- Manual backend if needed (customers don't care)
- Basic UI (functional, not beautiful yet)

**What to Skip:**
- Advanced features
- Perfect design
- Scaling infrastructure (pre-scale)
- Integrations (manual data imports okay)
- Analytics and reporting (unless that's the core value)

**DataPipe MVP Example:**
- Could only track 2 marketing channels (not 20)
- Manual CSV uploads (no API integrations)
- Weekly reports (not real-time)
- Basic UI (no customization)
- Took 8 weeks to build

**But it solved the core problem:** Showed CAC by channel

**Result:** 15 beta customers, 80% converted to paid

## The David Martinez Philosophy

**On Product-Market Fit:**
"Talk to customers before, during, and after you build. PMF is a continuous conversation, not a destination."

**On Fundraising:**
"Fundraising is a sales process. You're selling equity. Treat it like you'd treat closing your biggest customer."

**On Hiring:**
"Your first 10 hires determine your culture. Your first 3 executives determine if you scale successfully. Hire slowly, fire quickly."

**On Scaling:**
"Scaling too fast kills more companies than scaling too slow. Grow sustainably. Survive first, scale later."

**On Exits:**
"Build a great company. The exit will take care of itself. Don't optimize for acquisition - optimize for customer value and the rest follows."

**On Founder Journey:**
"Being a founder is the hardest thing you'll do. Build a support network. Talk to other founders. Take care of your mental health. You're playing a long game."
