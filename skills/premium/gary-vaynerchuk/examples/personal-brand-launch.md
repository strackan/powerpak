# Example: Launching a Personal Brand from Zero
## Using Gary's Frameworks

**Scenario:** You're a mid-level product manager at a B2B SaaS company. You want to build a personal brand to open doors for speaking, consulting, and eventually starting your own company.

**Current State:**
- 400 LinkedIn connections (mostly coworkers)
- No other social media presence
- Never posted content online
- Imposter syndrome holding you back

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Months 1-3)

### Self-Awareness Work

**What makes you different?**
- 8 years in B2B SaaS product management
- Launched 12+ features, 3 complete product lines
- Strong opinions on product-led growth
- Background in psychology (undergrad degree)
- Failed startup founder (learned expensive lessons)

**What value can you provide?**
- Product strategy frameworks
- Feature prioritization methods
- Customer research techniques
- PLG implementation playbooks
- Startup failure lessons

**Your authentic story:**
"I'm a product manager who's launched winners and failures. I use psychology principles to build products people actually want. I share what I'm learning in public so others don't make my expensive mistakes."

**Decision:** Focus on practical product management advice for B2B SaaS PMs.

---

### Platform Selection

**Where is your audience?**
- LinkedIn (B2B professionals, your target)
- Twitter/X (product community, real-time)
- YouTube (long-form education)

**Gary's guidance:** Pick ONE to start.

**Your choice:** LinkedIn
- Your audience is already there
- You have 400 connections (small but real network)
- Platform is currently favoring organic content (2024)
- Native format you can learn (professional + personal)

---

### Content Strategy: Document Don't Create

**What are you doing anyway that you can document?**

**Weekly recurring work:**
- Monday: Product roadmap reviews with stakeholders
- Tuesday: Customer research calls (2-3 per week)
- Wednesday: Sprint planning with engineering
- Thursday: Competitive analysis
- Friday: Product metrics review

**Content opportunity in each:**
- Roadmap reviews → Prioritization frameworks
- Customer calls → Research insights
- Sprint planning → Eng/Product collaboration tips
- Competitive analysis → Market observations
- Metrics review → What metrics actually matter

**The system:**
1. During each activity, take notes on one insight
2. After each activity, record 60-second voice memo
3. Friday afternoon, turn week's insights into 5 LinkedIn posts
4. Schedule for the following week

---

## PHASE 2: EXECUTION (Months 4-6)

### Week 1: First Posts

**Monday (Jab - Value):**
"Here's the prioritization framework I use with my product team:

Instead of RICE or weighted scoring (too complicated), we ask 3 questions:
1. Does this move our North Star metric?
2. Can we ship it in one sprint?
3. Will customers notice immediately?

If it's 3 yes's, we build it. If it's 3 no's, we kill it. If it's mixed, we debate.

Stolen from [mentor name]. Saved me hundreds of hours of analysis paralysis.

What's your prioritization framework?"

**Performance prediction:**
- 1,500 impressions (small network)
- 20-30 likes
- 3-5 comments
- 2 new connection requests

---

**Wednesday (Jab - Behind the Scenes):**
"Just finished a customer research call where the user said our new feature is 'fine.'

In PM world, 'fine' is a red flag. It means:
- They don't love it
- They won't tell their friends
- They'll switch if something better comes along

So I asked: 'What would make it from fine to f***ing amazing?'

Turns out we built what they asked for, not what they needed. Classic PM mistake.

Back to the drawing board. This is the messy part they don't show you in product case studies."

**Performance prediction:**
- 2,000 impressions (higher engagement = more reach)
- 35-40 likes
- 8-10 comments (controversial + relatable)
- 5 new connection requests

---

**Friday (Jab - Quick Win):**
"Free template: The customer research question bank I use on every call.

30 questions organized by:
- Problem discovery
- Solution validation
- Pricing research
- Feature prioritization

Link in comments. Steal it, use it, make it better.

(If you improve it, tag me. Let's make it better together.)"

**Performance prediction:**
- 3,500 impressions (high utility = shares)
- 60-80 likes
- 20+ comments (people asking for link, thanking you)
- 15 new connection requests
- Your first piece of "viral" content

---

### Results After 6 Weeks

**Quantitative:**
- 24 posts published
- 35,000 total impressions
- 600 new connections (now at 1,000)
- 150 profile views per week
- 3 DMs from people asking questions

**Qualitative:**
- Coworkers mentioning they saw your posts
- Recruiters reaching out
- Someone at a conference says "I follow you on LinkedIn"
- You're starting to feel less like an imposter

**The Gary reality check:**
This is still tiny. You're still nobody. But you're building.

---

## PHASE 3: ACCELERATION (Months 7-12)

### Increasing Volume

**Current:** 3-4 posts per week
**New goal:** Daily posts

**How to sustain daily without burnout:**

**Repurpose Everything:**
- That internal presentation? → LinkedIn carousel
- Slack conversation with eng team? → Post about collaboration
- Bug that cost you a week? → Post about technical debt
- Customer win email? → Case study post (with permission)
- Book you're reading? → Key takeaway posts

**Batch Creation:**
- Sunday evening: 60 minutes
- Review week's notes and voice memos
- Draft 7 posts for the week
- Schedule Monday-Friday using LinkedIn scheduler
- Keep 2 in reserve for spontaneous moments

---

### Adding Right Hooks

**Months 1-6:** All jabs (pure value, no asks)

**Month 7:** First right hook

**Example right hook post:**
"I've been sharing product management frameworks here for 6 months.

126 posts. 250,000 impressions. 2,500 amazing people in this community.

Thank you for following along.

Here's what I'm working on: A PM toolkit with all my frameworks, templates, and customer research scripts. The stuff I actually use every week.

If you'd want early access, comment 'toolkit' and I'll DM you when it's ready.

(It'll be free. I'm building this because you kept asking for it.)"

**Why this works:**
- 6 months of pure value earned the ask
- Not selling anything (free offering)
- Easy action (just comment)
- Gives back to the community
- Sets up email list for future

**Expected response:**
- 200+ comments saying "toolkit"
- You just built an email list of 200 warm leads
- These people will be your first customers when you do charge

---

### Expanding to Second Platform

**Month 9:** Add Twitter/X

**Strategy:** Repurpose LinkedIn posts as Twitter threads
- Take your best-performing LinkedIn posts
- Reformat as Twitter threads (10-15 tweets)
- Add thread hooks and engagement tactics
- Link back to LinkedIn for full content

**Example conversion:**
LinkedIn post (300 words) → Twitter thread:

"🧵 The prioritization framework I use with my product team

No RICE. No weighted scoring. Just 3 questions:

1. Does this move our North Star metric?
2. Can we ship it in one sprint?
3. Will customers notice immediately?

Here's how it works (1/12)"

[Rest of thread breaks down the framework]

**Why this works:**
- Content already proven on LinkedIn
- Different platform, new audience
- Minimal additional effort (reformatting only)
- Cross-pollination between platforms

---

## MONTH 12: RESULTS

**Metrics:**
- **LinkedIn:** 5,000 connections, 500K post impressions
- **Twitter:** 2,000 followers
- **Email list:** 800 subscribers (from free toolkit)
- **Recognition:** Known in your product management niche

**Opportunities that came from this:**
- 3 podcast interview invitations
- 2 conference speaking proposals
- 5 consulting inquiry DMs
- 1 job offer (unsolicited) at 40% higher comp
- Headhunter reached out about VP Product role

**You didn't take any of these** (yet). But now you have options.

**The Gary lesson:**
This is still just the beginning. You're at 1x. In year 3, you'll be at 10x. In year 5, 100x.

Keep posting. Keep documenting. Keep providing value.

The compound interest is just starting.

---

## YEAR 2-3: SCALE

**What changes:**

**1. Content Volume Increases**
- Hire a video editor (part-time, $500/month)
- Start filming daily behind-the-scenes clips
- Repurpose into Shorts/Reels/TikTok
- Now creating 20+ pieces of content per week

**2. Monetization Begins**
- Launch paid product ($49 course on product roadmapping)
- First month: 50 sales = $2,450
- Email list converts at 6% (800 subscribers × 6% = 48 sales)
- Not life-changing money, but validates the model

**3. Authority Compounds**
- Conference organizers reach out (you don't pitch them)
- Speaking fees: $2,500-5,000 per talk
- Brands asking for consulting (your day rate: $1,500)
- Other creators wanting to collaborate

**4. Optionality Expands**
- You could stay at your job (now with 3x leverage)
- You could consult full-time (clear path to $200K+)
- You could start your product (with built-in audience)
- You could take that VP role (your personal brand got you noticed)

**The Gary Philosophy:**
You're not trying to become an influencer. You're building a long-term personal brand asset that creates optionality and leverage.

The content is just the vehicle.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

**What worked:**
1. ✅ **Document don't create** - Sustainable, authentic content
2. ✅ **Platform focus** - LinkedIn first, then expand
3. ✅ **Jabs before right hooks** - 6 months of value before first ask
4. ✅ **Consistency** - Daily posting built the habit
5. ✅ **Authentic voice** - Shared failures, not just wins
6. ✅ **Volume game** - More at-bats led to hits

**What didn't work (at first):**
- ❌ Overly polished posts (lower engagement)
- ❌ Broad topics (niche content performed better)
- ❌ Asking for engagement ("What do you think?" posts flopped)
- ❌ Copying viral formats (felt inauthentic, didn't work)

**The Gary wisdom applied:**
- ✅ Speed over perfection - Published daily, not perfect
- ✅ Long-term thinking - Didn't expect results in month 1
- ✅ Authentic self - Shared real work, not generic advice
- ✅ Value first - Built goodwill before asking for anything
- ✅ Platform native - Learned LinkedIn's native format
- ✅ Patience - Year 1 was planting seeds, year 2-3 is harvest

**If you're starting from zero:**
Follow this playbook. It works. Gary's been preaching it for 15 years.

The only question is: Will you actually do the work?
