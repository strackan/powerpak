# Example: 90-Day Social Selling Transformation
## From Zero to Pipeline Using Jill's Framework

**Scenario:** You're an Enterprise Account Executive at a B2B SaaS company selling financial planning software. You've relied on cold outreach and inbound leads. Your pipeline is inconsistent and you're tired of being ignored.

**Current State:**
- LinkedIn profile is basic (looks like a resume)
- Never posted content
- 800 connections (mostly coworkers and college friends)
- Zero social selling skills
- Quota: $1.2M annually

**Goal:** Build social selling engine that generates 30% of your pipeline

## MONTH 1: FOUNDATION

### Week 1: Profile Optimization

**Monday: Audit Current Profile**

**Current Headline:**
"Enterprise Account Executive at FinanceTech Solutions"

**Score: 2/10** (just your job title)

**New Headline:**
"I help CFOs at growth-stage companies reduce financial close time by 50% | Enterprise Sales @ FinanceTech | Former Big 4 Consultant"

"Experienced sales professional with track record of exceeding quota..."

**Score: 1/10** (generic resume speak)

**New About Section:**
"I partner with CFOs at companies growing 40%+ annually who are struggling with manual financial processes that don't scale.

Most finance teams I meet are drowning in spreadsheets, disconnected systems, and month-end close cycles that take 15-20 days. When you're scaling fast, this becomes a critical blocker to growth and a compliance risk.

Over the past 5 years, I've helped 50+ CFOs modernize their financial close process:
→ Reduced close time from 15 days to 5 days (average)
→ Cut manual work by 60%
→ Improved accuracy and compliance
→ Gave leadership real-time financial visibility

My clients include [3 notable customers]. I previously spent 4 years at PwC working with public companies on financial controls.

If you're a CFO or VP Finance dealing with this pain, let's connect. I share frameworks and insights here regularly."

**Score: 9/10** (problem-focused, specific, credible, CTA)

"Enterprise Account Executive | FinanceTech Solutions | 2021-Present

Partnered with CFOs at 30+ growth-stage companies ($50M-$500M revenue) to modernize financial operations.

- Connection requests: 2 → 12 per week
- InMail from recruiters: 0 → 3

### Week 2-3: Network Building Strategy

**Goal:** Add 100 strategic connections

**Target Profiles:**
1. **CFOs at target accounts (30)** - Your ideal buyers
2. **VPs Finance at growth companies (30)** - Future CFOs, active buyers
3. **Finance influencers/thought leaders (20)** - Build your visibility
4. **Peers at partner/complementary companies (20)** - Referral sources

**Connection Request Template (Personalized for each):**

**To CFO at target account:**
"Hi [Name], I noticed [Company] recently raised Series B. Congratulations! I work with CFOs at fast-growing companies dealing with the financial operations challenges that come with scale. I share insights on this regularly - would love to connect."

**Acceptance rate:** 40-50%

**To Finance Influencer:**
"Hi [Name], I've been following your content on financial planning for growth companies - especially loved your recent post on [specific topic]. I work with CFOs dealing with these challenges daily. Would love to connect and learn from your perspective."

**Acceptance rate:** 60-70%

---

**Results After Week 2-3:**
- Sent 150 connection requests
- 80 accepted (53% acceptance rate)
- Network now: 880 connections
- 10 of your target accounts are now connections

---

### Week 4: Content Creation Begins

**Monday: First Post (Educational)**

"3 mistakes I see CFOs make when scaling from $50M to $100M:

1. **Waiting until it breaks** - By the time your financial close process is obviously broken, you're in crisis mode. Start planning the upgrade at $30M, implement at $50M.

2. **Optimizing for features, not workflow** - CFOs get sold on bells and whistles they'll never use. Focus on: Does this actually make my team's life easier?

3. **Underestimating change management** - New software is 20% of the work. Getting your team to adopt it is 80%. Plan for training and transition.

What would you add? What mistakes have you seen (or made)?"

**Performance:**
- 2,200 impressions
- 35 likes
- 8 comments (including 2 from target prospects)
- 4 profile views from CFOs at target accounts

---

**Wednesday: Second Post (Inspirational Story)**

"Just got off a call with a CFO who said something that hit me:

'For the first time in 3 years, I'm not working weekends during month-end close.'

She used to spend every first weekend of the month in the office, reconciling accounts and chasing down numbers.

Now? Her close is done in 5 days. Automated. Clean. She gets her weekends back.

This is what I love about what we do. Technology should give you your life back, not steal more of it.

If you're a finance leader working weekends to close the books, let's talk. It doesn't have to be this way."

**Performance:**
- 3,500 impressions (emotional posts perform better)
- 62 likes
- 12 comments
- 8 profile views
- 2 DMs: "This is exactly my life right now"

---

**Friday: Third Post (Educational)**

"The one metric that tells you if your financial close process will scale:

**Days to close.**

If you're taking 15+ days to close your books, here's what that actually costs you:

→ Leadership making decisions on 3-week-old data
→ Investors questioning your operational maturity
→ Your team burnt out every month-end
→ Compliance risk (tight timelines = errors)

We work with CFOs to cut close time to 5-7 days. Not by working harder. By automating the manual work that shouldn't exist.

What's your current close timeline? (Honest answers only - this is a judgment-free zone.)"

**Performance:**
- 4,100 impressions
- 71 likes
- 23 comments (people sharing their close times)
- 6 DMs asking about your solution

**First social-sourced opportunity:**
One of the DMs turns into a discovery call. Qualified opportunity. $200K potential deal.

---

**Results After Month 1:**
- **Profile:** Fully optimized, professional, valuable
- **Network:** 880 connections (+80)
- **Content:** 12 posts published (3/week)
- **Engagement:** 35K impressions, 250+ likes, 60+ comments
- **Pipeline:** 1 qualified opportunity ($200K) from social

**Time investment:** 5-7 hours/week

---

## MONTH 2: SCALE AND ENGAGEMENT

### Week 5-6: Increase Posting Frequency

**New cadence:** Daily posts (Monday-Friday)

**Content mix:**
- Monday: Educational (framework, tip, mistake to avoid)
- Tuesday: Behind-the-scenes (real work story)
- Wednesday: Customer story (with permission)
- Thursday: Hot take or contrarian view
- Friday: Resource or template (free value)

**Example Monday post:**

"The financial close maturity model I use with every CFO:

**LEVEL 1: CHAOS**
- Close takes 20+ days
- All manual, spreadsheet-heavy
- Errors are common
- Team is burnt out

**LEVEL 2: STABILIZED**
- Close takes 10-15 days
- Some automation
- Process documented
- Still painful

**LEVEL 3: OPTIMIZED**
- Close takes 5-7 days
- Mostly automated
- Real-time visibility
- Team has capacity for strategic work

**LEVEL 4: CONTINUOUS**
- Close in 1-3 days
- Fully automated
- Always audit-ready
- Finance is strategic partner, not order-taker

Most companies move from Level 1 → 2 → 3 over 2-3 years.

The ones that win move from 1 → 3 in 6-12 months.

Where is your organization today?"

**Performance:** 5,200 impressions, 89 likes, 31 comments

---

**Example Thursday post (Hot Take):**

"Unpopular opinion:

CFOs don't need better dashboards.

They need better data.

I see so many companies investing in fancy BI tools and real-time dashboards while their underlying data is a mess.

You can't dashboard your way out of bad data.

Fix the source of truth first. Then visualize it.

Am I wrong here?"

**Performance:** 7,800 impressions (controversial posts get shared more), 134 likes, 47 comments (healthy debate)

---

### Week 5-6: Strategic Engagement

**Daily engagement routine (30 min/day):**

**8:00am - LinkedIn Feed Scan (10 min):**
- Find 10 posts from target personas (CFOs, VPs Finance)
- Leave thoughtful comments (not "great post!")

**Example thoughtful comment:**
"This resonates. I worked with a CFO last quarter dealing with exactly this - the close time was killing them during their Series B diligence. They ended up building a 'close command center' (literally a war room) to get it under control. It worked, but it's not sustainable. Curious what others have tried?"

---

**12:00pm - Target Account Monitoring (10 min):**
- Check activity from your target accounts
- Engage with their content
- Note any buying signals (hiring finance ops, mentioning pain points, sharing challenges)

---

**5:00pm - Thought Leader Engagement (10 min):**
- Engage with finance influencer content
- Build visibility in your niche
- Learn from their approaches

---

**Results After Week 5-6:**
- Posted 10 more times (now 22 total)
- 65K total impressions
- 15 meaningful conversations in DMs
- 3 discovery calls booked from social engagement
- Target accounts seeing your name everywhere

---

### Week 7-8: Warm Outreach to Target Accounts

**Now that you've:**
- Built credibility through content
- Engaged with prospects' posts
- Appeared in their feed regularly

**You're warm, not cold.**

**Outreach template (LinkedIn DM):**

"Hi [Name],

I've been following your posts about [specific challenge they mentioned]. Really resonated with your point about [specific thing].

I work with CFOs at growth-stage companies dealing with similar challenges - specifically around financial close process as you scale.

Would it make sense to have a quick 15-minute conversation? I've seen a few patterns with companies at your stage that might be helpful.

Either way, I'll keep sharing insights here that might be useful.

Best,
[Your name]"

**Why this works:**
- You've been visible to them already
- You reference their content (shows you're paying attention)
- Specific and relevant
- Low-pressure ask
- Provides value even if they say no

**Response rate:** 45% (vs 5% cold outreach)

---

**Results After Month 2:**
- **Network:** 950 connections (+70)
- **Content:** 42 posts total (scaling to daily)
- **Engagement:** 125K impressions, 600+ likes, 180+ comments
- **Pipeline:** 5 qualified opportunities, $850K total
- **Social-sourced pipeline:** 35% of your total pipeline

**Time investment:** 7-10 hours/week (but it's working)

---

## MONTH 3: OPTIMIZATION AND SCALING

### Week 9-10: Content Repurposing

**Problem:** Daily posting is getting hard to sustain

**Solution:** Repurpose existing content

**One customer story becomes:**
1. LinkedIn post (Monday)
2. Twitter thread (Tuesday)
3. Case study PDF (Wednesday - shared in Featured section)
4. Email to prospects dealing with same challenge (Thursday)
5. Talking point in sales calls (ongoing)

**One framework becomes:**
1. LinkedIn post explaining it
2. Carousel post (visual version)
3. Short video walking through it (1-2 min)
4. Downloadable template
5. Workshop topic for target accounts

---

### Week 9-10: Video Content Introduction

**New format:** Short videos (60-90 seconds)

**Topics:**
- Quick tips
- Customer stories
- Responses to common objections
- Behind-the-scenes moments

**Example:**
Film yourself at your desk:

"Quick story: Just got off a call with a CFO who's closing their books in 18 days. They're about to go through Series C diligence.

I asked: 'What do you think your investors will say when they see an 18-day close?'

He paused. Then: 'They're going to think we don't have our shit together.'

Exactly.

Your financial operations are a signal of your operational maturity. Investors notice.

If you're raising capital and your close process is slow, let's talk before you're in the due diligence process.

[Link in comments]"

**Performance:**
- 12,000 impressions (video posts get more reach)
- 187 likes
- 34 comments
- 8 DMs from CFOs raising capital

---

### Week 11-12: Account-Based Social Selling

**For each account:**

**1. Follow all key stakeholders (5-7 people)**
- CFO
- VP Finance
- Controller
- Finance Ops Manager
- CEO (if financially-focused)

**2. Engage with their content daily**
- Thoughtful comments
- Share their posts (with your take)
- Celebrate their wins

**3. Create content that speaks to their challenges**
- Research their company challenges
- Create posts addressing those specific pains
- Tag them if relevant (tastefully)

**4. Warm DM after 2-3 weeks of engagement**

By the time you reach out, you're not a stranger.

---

**Example execution:**

**Target: GrowthCo (Series B SaaS, $60M ARR)**

**Week 1: Research & Follow**
- Follow CFO, VP Finance, Controller
- Note their recent funding announcement
- Identify pain point: "Scaling financial operations post-funding"

**Week 2: Engage**
- Comment on CFO's post about hiring challenges
- Share article relevant to their stage
- Like and engage with 10+ posts from account

**Week 3: Create relevant content**
Post: "3 things Series B CFOs should do in their first 90 days after funding..."
(Directly relevant to GrowthCo's stage)

**Week 4: Warm outreach**
"Hi [CFO name], congrats again on the Series B. I've been thinking about your post on scaling finance ops - I work with CFOs at exactly this stage. Would love to share what I'm seeing other Series B companies do. 15 min call make sense?"
