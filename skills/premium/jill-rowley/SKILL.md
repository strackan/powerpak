## PART 1: SOCIAL SELLING FOUNDATIONS

### What Is Social Selling?

**Jill's Definition:**
Social selling is using social networks to find, connect with, understand, and nurture sales prospects. It's about leveraging your professional brand to fill your pipeline with better leads.

**What Social Selling Is NOT:**
- ❌ Spamming people on LinkedIn
- ❌ Pitching in DMs to strangers
- ❌ Automating connection requests
- ❌ Replacing actual selling
- ❌ A magic shortcut

**What Social Selling IS:**
- ✅ Building relationships before you need them
- ✅ Providing value before asking for anything
- ✅ Being present where your buyers are
- ✅ Establishing credibility and trust
- ✅ Creating warm opportunities instead of cold ones

**The Shift:**
```
OLD SALES:
Cold call → Pitch → Demo → Close (maybe)

NEW SALES:
Build presence → Add value → Earn trust → Buyer reaches out → Consult → Close (likely)
```

---

### The Social Selling Index (SSI)

**LinkedIn's SSI measures four pillars:**

**1. Establish Your Professional Brand (25%)**
- Complete, optimized LinkedIn profile
- Profile views and engagement
- Content you publish
- Your headline and summary tell your story

**2. Find the Right People (25%)**
- Using LinkedIn to research accounts
- Identifying decision-makers
- Understanding org structures
- Finding warm paths to buyers

**3. Engage with Insights (25%)**
- Sharing relevant content
- Commenting meaningfully
- Providing value in feed
- Building visibility with target accounts

**4. Build Relationships (25%)**
- Growing your network strategically
- Nurturing connections
- Maintaining relationships
- Creating advocates

**Jill's Take:**
SSI is directionally useful but don't obsess over the score. Focus on the behaviors the score is trying to measure: brand, targeting, engagement, relationships.

### Your LinkedIn Profile as a Sales Asset

**The Mindset Shift:**
Your LinkedIn profile isn't your resume. It's your storefront. It's your 24/7 sales rep.

**Headline (220 characters):**

**❌ Bad:**
"Enterprise Sales Executive at Acme Corp"

**✅ Good:**
"I help CFOs at mid-market companies reduce financial close time by 40% | Enterprise Sales at Acme Corp | Former Big 4"

**Why it works:**
- Leads with value (what you do for customers)
- Targets specific buyer (CFOs at mid-market)
- Quantifies outcome (40% reduction)
- Adds credibility (Former Big 4)

---

**About Section (2,600 characters):**

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (What you do and for whom)
2. **Problem** (What pain you solve)
3. **Approach** (How you solve it differently)
4. **Proof** (Results, customers, credentials)
5. **Call to Action** (How to engage)

**Example:**

"I partner with CFOs and finance leaders at growth-stage companies who are drowning in manual financial processes and worried about compliance as they scale.

Most finance teams are stuck using disconnected tools, spreadsheets, and way too much manual work. When you're growing 40%+ year-over-year, that doesn't scale. And it's a recipe for errors that keep you up at night.

Over the past 8 years, I've helped 200+ finance teams modernize their financial close process, cutting close time from 15 days to 5 days, reducing errors by 60%, and giving CFOs real-time visibility into their numbers.

My clients include [notable customers]. I previously spent 6 years at Deloitte working with public companies on SOX compliance.

If you're a CFO or finance leader dealing with this pain, let's talk. Send me a message or connect here."

---

**Featured Section:**
- Case studies
- Customer testimonials
- Valuable content you've created
- Videos of you presenting
- One-pagers and resources

**Activity:**
- Post 2-3x per week minimum
- Comment daily on others' posts
- Share insights, not pitches
- Be consistent

---

## PART 2: CONTENT STRATEGY FOR SELLERS

### Why Sellers Need to Create Content

**The Buying Reality:**
- 75% of B2B buyers use social media to research vendors (IDC)
- 84% of C-level executives use social to make purchase decisions (IDG)
- Buyers complete 70% of their journey before talking to sales (Forrester)

**The Implication:**
If you're not visible and credible online, you don't exist to modern buyers.

**Content is NOT marketing's job alone. It's your job.**

---

### The Content Framework for Sellers

**Three Content Types:**

**1. EDUCATIONAL (60% of your content)**
Share knowledge that helps your buyers:
- Industry trends
- Best practices
- How-to guides
- Frameworks and models
- Common mistakes
- Lessons learned

**Example post:**
"3 mistakes I see CFOs make when selecting financial software:

1. Optimizing for features instead of workflows
2. Underestimating change management
3. Not involving their team in evaluation

Here's what to do instead: [value]"

---

**2. INSPIRATIONAL (30%)**
Stories that connect emotionally:
- Customer success stories
- Personal journey moments
- Behind-the-scenes
- Wins and losses
- Values and beliefs

**Example post:**
"Just got off a call with a CFO who cried.

Not because something went wrong. Because for the first time in 3 years, she closed her books in 5 days instead of 15.

She said: 'I get to see my kids before bedtime now.'

This is why I do what I do. Technology should give you your life back."

---

**3. PROMOTIONAL (10%)**
The ask, the pitch, the sale:
- Product launches
- Event invitations
- Resource offers
- Demo requests

**Example post:**
"We just launched the feature our customers have been asking for: real-time cash flow forecasting.

If you're a CFO who wants to see your cash position update automatically instead of waiting for month-end, let's talk.

Comment 'forecast' and I'll send you early access."

**The 60/30/10 Rule keeps you valuable instead of annoying.**

---

### Content That Works on LinkedIn

**Post Formats That Perform:**

**1. Personal Story with Business Lesson**
- 200-300 words
- Start with hook
- Tell story
- Land the lesson
- Ask engaging question

**2. Contrarian Take**
- Challenge common wisdom
- Back it with experience
- Invite debate
- Stay professional

**3. Lists and Frameworks**
- "5 ways to..."
- "3 mistakes..."
- "The framework I use for..."
- Digestible and shareable

**4. Customer Wins**
- Celebrate customer success
- Show specific results
- Tag the customer (with permission)
- Demonstrate value

**5. Behind-the-Scenes**
- Show your process
- Share what you're learning
- Be authentic
- Humanize yourself

**Commenting Strategy:**
- Comment MORE than you post
- Add value, don't just say "great post"
- Engage with prospects' content
- Engage with customers' content
- Engage with industry leaders

---

## PART 3: ACCOUNT-BASED EVERYTHING

### Beyond Account-Based Marketing

**The Evolution:**

**ABM (Account-Based Marketing):**
Marketing targets specific accounts with personalized campaigns.

**ABS (Account-Based Sales):**
Sales orchestrates personalized outreach to target accounts.

**ABE (Account-Based Everything):**
Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, and Product all align around target accounts.

**Jill's Philosophy:**
Accounts don't buy. People do. Account-Based Everything is really People-Based Everything.

---

### The ABE Framework

**Step 1: Account Selection**

**Not all accounts are created equal. Choose accounts that:**
- ✅ Match your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
- ✅ Have the budget you need
- ✅ Are showing buying signals
- ✅ You have a path into (warm intro, shared connection)
- ✅ Would be great case studies if you win

**Tiering:**
- **Tier 1 (20 accounts):** Most important, highest effort, customized everything
- **Tier 2 (50 accounts):** Important, moderate effort, semi-customized
- **Tier 3 (200 accounts):** Qualified, lower effort, scaled personalization

---

**Step 2: Account Research**

**For each Tier 1 account, know:**
- Company priorities and initiatives (10-K, earnings calls, press releases)
- Key executives and decision-makers (LinkedIn, org charts)
- Technology stack (BuiltWith, LinkedIn profiles, job postings)
- Recent news and triggers (funding, acquisitions, leadership changes)
- Current challenges (Glassdoor, industry reports, social posts)
- Your connections and warm paths (LinkedIn, mutual contacts)

**Time investment:** 1-2 hours per Tier 1 account

---

**Step 3: Relationship Mapping**

**Identify the buying committee:**

**Economic Buyer** (has budget authority)
- Usually VP or C-level
- Makes final decision
- Controls budget

**Champion** (internal advocate)
- Wants you to win
- Has influence
- Selling on your behalf internally

**Decision Criteria Owner** (defines requirements)
- Usually senior manager or director
- Creates RFP or evaluation criteria
- Heavily influences decision

**Technical Buyer** (validates solution)
- IT, Security, Compliance
- Can say no (veto power)
- Focuses on risk mitigation

**User/End User** (will use the product)
- Day-to-day user
- Cares about usability
- Can tank deal if they hate it

**Coach** (insider giving you intel)
- Helps you navigate politics
- May or may not be your champion
- Provides strategic guidance

**Map relationships:**
- Who knows whom?
- Who has influence over whom?
- Who's the blocker?
- Who's your entry point?

---

**Step 4: Multi-Threading**

**Jill's Rule:**
If you're single-threaded, you're at risk. If your one contact leaves, ghosts you, or loses political capital, your deal is dead.

**Multi-threading means:**
- Relationships with 3-5 people in the account
- At multiple levels (senior + day-to-day)
- Across multiple departments (business + technical)
- Including your champion + economic buyer

**How to multi-thread:**
1. Ask for introductions ("Who else should be part of this conversation?")
2. Provide value that requires sharing ("I created this ROI analysis for your CFO")
3. Run workshops or pilots (gets multiple stakeholders involved)
4. Engage on LinkedIn with multiple contacts
5. Get introduced by existing relationships

---

**Step 5: Orchestrated Plays**

**Everyone in your company aligns around the target account:**

**Marketing:**
- Targeted ads to account employees
- Personalized direct mail
- Event invitations
- Content relevant to their challenges

**Sales (You):**
- Strategic outreach to mapped contacts
- Value-based conversations
- Navigate decision process
- Close the deal

**Sales Development:**
- Research and identify contacts
- Book meetings with buying committee
- Nurture stakeholders not yet engaged

**Customer Success (if they're existing customer):**
- Advocacy and expansion
- Executive business reviews
- Identify upsell opportunities

**Product/Engineering:**
- Product demos tailored to use case
- Custom proof of concepts
- Roadmap alignment conversations

**Leadership:**
- Executive sponsorship
- C-level to C-level relationships
- Strategic partnership discussions

**The key:** Everyone's rowing in the same direction for these strategic accounts.

---

## PART 4: RELATIONSHIP-DRIVEN SELLING

### Building Trust Before Transactions

**The Old Way:**
Meet → Pitch → Close → Disappear

**The Jill Way:**
Add value → Build trust → Earn the right → Advise → Partner for life

**Trust-Building Activities:**

**1. Share Insights Freely**
- Industry trends they should know
- Competitive intelligence
- Introductions to helpful people
- Resources and templates

**2. Be a Consultant, Not a Peddler**
- Ask diagnostic questions
- Understand their business deeply
- Recommend competitors if you're not the fit
- Challenge their thinking

**3. Demonstrate Expertise**
- Publish thought leadership
- Speak at their events
- Share customer stories
- Provide perspective, not pitches

**4. Show Up Consistently**
- Engage with their content
- Send relevant articles
- Check in without an ask
- Be present over time

**The Timeline:**
Trust isn't built in one call. It's built over 6-12 months of consistent value.

---

### Buyer Enablement

**The Concept:**
Your buyer has to "sell" your solution internally. Your job is to enable them to win that internal sale.

**How to Enable Your Buyer:**

**1. Arm Them with Business Case**
- ROI calculator
- One-pager for executives
- Comparison matrix
- Risk mitigation doc

**2. Help Them Build Consensus**
- Identify who needs to be involved
- Provide materials for each stakeholder
- Offer to present to the team
- Address objections proactively

**3. Navigate Procurement**
- Simplify contracts
- Provide security documentation
- Speed up legal review
- Make it easy to say yes

**4. Champion Your Champion**
- Make them look like a hero
- Give them credit for the win
- Celebrate their leadership
- Help them with their career

**Remember:** You're selling through your champion, not to them.

---

## PART 5: CEO OF YOU, INC.

### Your Career is Your Business

**Jill's Philosophy:**
You're not an employee. You're the CEO of You, Inc. Your company (your employer) is your current client.

**The Mindset Shift:**

**Employee Mindset:**
- Company owes me security
- Loyalty to company
- Wait for promotions
- Resume is my marketing
- Success = climbing ladder

**CEO Mindset:**
- I'm responsible for my employability
- Loyalty to my growth
- Create opportunities
- Personal brand is my marketing
- Success = expanding options

---

### Building You, Inc.

**Your Business Model:**

**Your Product:**
Your skills, expertise, and unique value

**Your Customers:**
- Current employer (primary client)
- Future employers (prospects)
- Your network (advocates and referral sources)

**Your Marketing:**
- LinkedIn presence
- Content you create
- Speaking and teaching
- Network and reputation

**Your Sales:**
- Interviews and negotiations
- Internal visibility and influence
- Relationship building
- Value demonstration

**Your R&D:**
- Continuous learning
- Skill development
- Staying current
- Experimenting and failing

---

### Investing in You, Inc.

**Annual Budget for Your Development:**

**Education (10% of income):**
- Courses and certifications
- Books and resources
- Conferences and events
- Coaching or mentorship

**Network (5% of income):**
- Association memberships
- Event attendance
- Coffee meetings
- Giving before getting

**Tools (2% of income):**
- LinkedIn Premium
- SaaS tools that make you better
- Hardware that improves productivity

**Brand (3% of income):**
- Professional photos
- Content creation tools
- Website or portfolio
- Thoughtful gifts for relationships

**Total: 20% of income reinvested in You, Inc.**

Most people invest 0%. That's why they struggle.

---

### Your Advisory Board

**Every CEO needs advisors. So do you.**

**Build a personal board of advisors (5-7 people):**

1. **The Mentor** - 10+ years ahead, achieved what you want
2. **The Peer** - Same stage, different perspective
3. **The Challenger** - Pushes your thinking, doesn't let you settle
4. **The Connector** - Knows everyone, opens doors
5. **The Specialist** - Expert in skill you need to develop
6. **The Outside Voice** - Different industry/function, fresh perspective
7. **The Champion** - Believes in you, advocates for you

**How to activate your advisory board:**
- Quarterly check-ins (formal or informal)
- Specific asks, not vague "pick your brain"
- Share your wins and challenges
- Ask for feedback and accountability
- Give back (introduce them to others, share resources)

---

## PART 6: SALES-MARKETING ALIGNMENT

### Why Alignment Matters

**The Cost of Misalignment:**
- Marketing generates leads sales says are "not ready"
- Sales ignores leads marketing worked hard to generate
- Conflicting messages to market
- Wasted budget and effort
- Finger-pointing when numbers miss

**The Revenue Impact of Alignment:**
Companies with strong sales-marketing alignment achieve 20%+ annual revenue growth (compared to 4% decline for misaligned companies) - SiriusDecisions

---

### The Alignment Framework

**1. Shared Definitions**

**What is a lead?**
**What is a Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)?**
**What is a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)?**
**What is an opportunity?**

Define these together. Document them. Measure them consistently.

---

**2. Agreed-Upon SLA (Service Level Agreement)**

**Marketing commits to:**
- X number of MQLs per month
- Y% conversion rate from MQL to SQL
- Z days to follow up on inbound inquiries

**Sales commits to:**
- Follow up on MQLs within 24 hours
- Provide feedback on lead quality within 48 hours
- Accept or reject leads (with reason) within 1 week
- Input activity and outcomes into CRM

---

**3. Closed-Loop Reporting**

**Marketing needs to know:**
- Which leads converted to opportunities?
- Which leads converted to customers?
- What was the revenue?
- What's the ROI of each channel?

**Sales needs to share:**
- What happened with every lead?
- Why did they buy (or not)?
- What messages resonated?
- What objections came up?

**The feedback loop makes both teams better.**

---

**4. Joint Planning**

**Quarterly business reviews together:**
- What worked last quarter?
- What didn't?
- What are we learning?
- Where should we invest?
- What should we kill?

**Co-create:**
- Ideal customer profile
- Buyer personas
- Messaging and positioning
- Content strategy
- Campaign plans

---

**5. Shared Metrics**

**Instead of:**
- Marketing measured on leads
- Sales measured on revenue

**Try:**
- Both measured on pipeline generated
- Both measured on revenue
- Both measured on customer acquisition cost

**When both teams share a revenue goal, alignment is natural.**
