## PART 1: FIRST-TIME MANAGER TRANSITION

### The Identity Shift

**Marcus's Framework:**
The transition from individual contributor to manager is an identity change, not a promotion.

**What Changes:**

**AS AN IC:**
- Your success = your output
- Do the work yourself
- Expertise in your domain
- Control over your work
- Predictable day

**AS A MANAGER:**
- Your success = team's output
- Get work done through others
- Generalist + people skills
- Influence, not control
- Unpredictable, reactive

**The Challenge:**
Everything that made you successful as an IC (doing great work yourself) will make you fail as a manager.

### Common First-Time Manager Mistakes

**1. Doing Instead of Delegating**
**The mistake:** Taking on work yourself because it's faster or "easier"
**Why it's bad:** You don't scale, team doesn't grow, you burn out
**Fix:** Delegate even when it's slower initially

**2. Avoiding Difficult Conversations**
**The mistake:** Hoping performance issues resolve themselves
**Why it's bad:** Issues fester, team morale suffers, respect erodes
**Fix:** Address problems early and directly

**3. Being Everyone's Friend**
**The mistake:** Trying to be liked by everyone
**Why it's bad:** Hard to give tough feedback, make hard decisions, hold accountability
**Fix:** Be respected, not necessarily liked. Kind, not nice.

**4. Micromanaging**
**The mistake:** Dictating exactly how to do every task
**Why it's bad:** Team doesn't develop, you're bottleneck, kills morale
**Fix:** Define outcomes, let them own the how

**5. Not Managing Up**
**The mistake:** Shielding your boss from everything
**Why it's bad:** Boss is surprised, you don't get support, team's work is invisible
**Fix:** Communicate regularly, no surprises, advocate for team

---

## PART 2: DELIVERING FEEDBACK

### The Feedback Philosophy

**Marcus's Belief:**
Feedback is a gift. Withholding feedback is robbing someone of the chance to improve.

**The Two Types:**

**Reinforcing Feedback (Positive):**
- What they did well
- Keep doing this
- Recognize and appreciate
- Give often (daily)

**Redirecting Feedback (Constructive):**
- What to do differently
- Specific behavior change
- Help them improve
- Give promptly (don't wait)

---

### The SBI Framework (Situation-Behavior-Impact)

**Structure:**

**S = Situation** (When and where)
**B = Behavior** (What they did, objectively)
**I = Impact** (The effect it had)

---

**Example 1: Positive Feedback**

**Situation:** "In yesterday's client meeting..."
**Behavior:** "...when the client pushed back on pricing, you calmly walked through the ROI breakdown..."
**Impact:** "...which helped them see the value. They signed the contract. That was excellent sales execution."

---

**Example 2: Constructive Feedback**

**Situation:** "In this morning's team meeting..."
**Behavior:** "...you interrupted Sarah twice while she was presenting her proposal..."
**Impact:** "...which made her shut down and not finish her idea. The team noticed. I need you to let people finish their thoughts."

---

**Why SBI Works:**
- Specific (not vague)
- Objective (observable behavior)
- Timely (recent situation)
- Actionable (clear what to change)
- Non-judgmental (about behavior, not character)

---

### Difficult Conversations

**When to Have Them:**
- Performance not meeting expectations
- Behavioral issues (attitude, teamwork, professionalism)
- Misalignment on priorities
- Conflict between team members
- Delivering bad news (no promotion, budget cut, etc.)

**Marcus's Formula:**

**1. Prepare**
- What's the specific issue?
- What's the desired outcome?
- What's your evidence/examples?
- What questions might they ask?
- What's your tone/mindset?

**2. Open with Clarity**
"I want to talk about [specific issue]. I've noticed [specific behavior/outcome]. Let's discuss."

**3. Share Your Observations**
Use SBI framework. Be specific, factual.

**4. Listen to Their Perspective**
"Help me understand your view."
"What's your take on this?"
Actually listen. Don't interrupt.

**5. Align on the Problem**
"Here's what I'm seeing. Here's what you're seeing. Can we agree that [issue] needs to be addressed?"

**6. Collaborate on Solution**
"What do you think you could do differently?"
"What support do you need from me?"
Co-create the plan.

**7. Clarify Expectations**
"So we're aligned: You'll [specific action] by [date]. I'll [support]. We'll check in [when]."

**8. Follow Up**
Actually check in. Hold them accountable. Provide support.

---

### The Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Conversation

**The Setup:**
This is serious. Career is at risk. Be clear.

**The Script:**

"[Name], I want to talk about your performance. Over the past [time period], I've shared feedback about [issue]. Despite our conversations, I'm not seeing the improvement I need.

Specifically: [examples with dates and impacts]

We're now at the point where I need to put you on a formal Performance Improvement Plan. Here's what that means:

- For the next [60/90] days, you need to demonstrate [specific improvements]
- I'll provide [support, resources, coaching]
- We'll check in [frequency]
- If we see improvement, great. If not, we'll need to part ways.

I want you to succeed. This is your opportunity to turn it around. But I need to be direct: if things don't improve, you won't continue in this role.

What questions do you have?"

**The Tone:**
- Direct, not mean
- Clear, not ambiguous
- Supportive, not punishing
- Firm, not apologetic

---

## PART 3: EXECUTIVE PRESENCE

### What Is Executive Presence?

**Marcus's Definition:**
Executive presence is the ability to inspire confidence that you're capable of leading, that you know what you're doing, and that you can handle the pressure.

**The Three Pillars:**

**1. GRAVITAS (How You Act)**
- Confidence under pressure
- Decisive when needed
- Composed in chaos
- Credible and trustworthy

**2. COMMUNICATION (How You Speak)**
- Clear and concise
- Compelling storytelling
- Adapts to audience
- Commands attention

**3. APPEARANCE (How You Show Up)**
- Appropriate dress
- Body language
- Energy and presence
- Polished but authentic

---

### Building Gravitas

**Marcus's Techniques:**

**1. Own the Room**
- Enter with confidence
- Make eye contact
- Firm handshake
- Take your space (don't shrink)

**2. Pause Before Responding**
- Don't rush to fill silence
- Think, then speak
- Shows thoughtfulness
- Projects confidence

**3. Speak Last in Meetings (Sometimes)**
- Let others share first
- Synthesize what you heard
- Add your perspective
- Shows you listen and think strategically

**4. Handle Pressure with Composure**
- When challenged, don't get defensive
- Acknowledge the concern
- Respond with data or logic
- Stay calm

**5. Admit When You Don't Know**
- "I don't have that data right now. I'll get it to you by end of day."
- Better than bullshitting
- Shows integrity

---

### Communicating with Executives

**The Rule: Bottom-Line-Up-Front (BLUF)**

Executives are busy. Start with the conclusion, then provide details if needed.

**Bad:**
"So we talked to the customer, and they had some concerns about the pricing model, and we discussed different options, and they mentioned their budget constraints, and we think..."

**Good:**
"Customer wants to move forward at $80K instead of $100K. Here's why I think we should take it: [3 reasons]. What do you think?"

---

**The Pyramid Framework:**

```
        CONCLUSION
       /          \
  KEY POINT 1   KEY POINT 2   KEY POINT 3
      |              |               |
   Supporting     Supporting      Supporting
     Details        Details         Details
```

**Example:**

**Top:** "We should pivot to enterprise focus"

**Layer 2:**
- SMB CAC is too high
- Enterprise deals are closing faster
- Market is shifting upmarket

**Layer 3:** (Only if they ask)
- SMB CAC: $8K, LTV: $10K (unsustainable)
- Enterprise avg close time: 90 days vs 120 before
- Competitors moving upmarket, SMB getting commoditized

---

### Managing Up

**What Is Managing Up?**
Proactively managing your relationship with your boss so you both succeed.

**Marcus's Managing Up Framework:**

**1. Understand Your Boss's Priorities**
- What keeps them up at night?
- What are they measured on?
- What's important to their boss?
- How can you make them successful?

**2. Communicate Proactively**
- No surprises (bad news early)
- Regular updates (don't wait to be asked)
- Ask for feedback
- Clarify expectations

**3. Bring Solutions, Not Just Problems**
"Here's the issue. Here are 3 options. Here's what I recommend and why. What do you think?"

**4. Make Them Look Good**
- Deliver on commitments
- High-quality work
- Represent them well
- Give them credit

**5. Adapt to Their Style**
- Prefer written updates or verbal?
- Morning person or evening?
- High-level or detailed?
- Fast decisions or time to think?

---

## PART 4: EFFECTIVE 1:1S

- Align on priorities
- Remove blockers

**Frequency:**

- Your boss: Weekly

---

### The 1:1 Structure

---

**Marcus's 1:1 Questions:**

**Weekly Rotation:**

- "What help do you need from me?"

**Week 2: People Focus**
- "How's the team dynamic?"
- "Any conflicts or concerns?"
- "Who's doing great work I should know about?"

**Week 3: Career Focus**
- "What do you want to get better at?"
- "What's energizing you right now?"
- "What's draining you?"

**Week 4: Strategic Focus**

---

### Team Meeting Best Practices

**Marcus's Meeting Rules:**

**1. Have a Clear Purpose**
Every meeting needs to be one of these:
- **Information sharing** (could this be an email?)
- **Decision making** (who decides?)
- **Problem solving** (what's the problem?)
- **Team building** (connection and culture)

If it's none of these, cancel it.

**2. Start and End on Time**
- Respect people's calendars
- Start without stragglers
- End on time even if agenda isn't done

**3. Everyone Participates**
- Call on quiet people
- "What's your take, [name]?"
- Use round-robin for input

**4. No Devices (Unless Needed for Meeting)**
- Laptops closed
- Phones away
- Be present

**5. End with Action Items**
- Who's doing what?
- By when?
- How will we know it's done?
