## PART 1: PRODUCT STRATEGY

### Customer-Centric Product Philosophy

**Maya's Core Belief:**
Your product exists to solve customer problems, not to showcase technology. Fall in love with the problem, not your solution.

**The Mindset:**
```
BAD: "We built this cool feature with AI"
GOOD: "Customers were spending 4 hours/week on manual work. We automated it."
```

**Key Principles:**

**1. Talk to Customers Obsessively**
- 5-10 customer conversations per week minimum
- Mix of users, buyers, and churned customers
- Ask about problems, not features
- Listen more than you talk

**2. Measure Outcomes, Not Outputs**
- Don't measure features shipped
- Measure customer value delivered
- Track adoption and engagement
- Monitor business impact

**3. Ship Fast, Learn Faster**
- Perfect is the enemy of shipped
- Get to market, gather feedback
- Iterate based on real usage
- Kill features that don't work

**4. Say No More Than Yes**
- Your roadmap is 10% of what you could build
- Saying yes to everything = mediocrity
- Protect focus and execution
- Explain the "why" behind no

---

### Building Product Vision

**The Framework:**

**Vision (3-5 years):**
Where is the product going long-term?

**Example:**
"Become the operating system for customer success teams, enabling CS professionals to manage all customer interactions, health scoring, and expansion in one platform."

**Strategy (1-2 years):**
How will you achieve the vision?

**Example:**
"Focus on three pillars:
1. Best-in-class health scoring (differentiate here)
2. Seamless integrations (remove friction)
3. Workflow automation (reduce manual work)"

**Roadmap (3-6 months):**
What are you building next?

**Example:**
"Q1: Launch automated health scoring
Q2: Build Salesforce + HubSpot integrations
Q3: Ship workflow automation v1"

---

## PART 2: PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORKS

### RICE Scoring

**R = Reach (how many customers affected?)**
- Number of customers/users impacted per quarter
- Measured in users/customers, not percentage

**I = Impact (how much will it help each customer?)**
- 3 = Massive impact
- 2 = High impact
- 1 = Medium impact
- 0.5 = Low impact
- 0.25 = Minimal impact

**C = Confidence (how sure are you?)**
- 100% = High confidence (data, research, validation)
- 80% = Medium confidence (some validation)
- 50% = Low confidence (mostly assumptions)

**E = Effort (how long to build?)**
- Person-months required
- Include design, engineering, QA, docs

**Formula:**
```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Example:
Feature A:
- Reach: 500 customers/quarter
- Impact: 2 (high)
- Confidence: 80%
- Effort: 3 person-months

RICE = (500 × 2 × 0.8) / 3 = 266.7

Feature B:
- Reach: 1000 customers/quarter
- Impact: 1 (medium)
- Confidence: 100%
- Effort: 6 person-months

RICE = (1000 × 1 × 1.0) / 6 = 166.7

Priority: Feature A > Feature B
```

---

### The 2x2 Priority Matrix

**Axes:**
- X-axis: Effort (Low → High)
- Y-axis: Value (Low → High)

**Quadrants:**

**Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Value):**
- Do these first
- Ship this quarter
- Maximum ROI

**Strategic Bets (High Effort, High Value):**
- Plan carefully
- Dedicate resources
- Long-term payoff
- Do 1-2 per quarter max

**Fill-ins (Low Effort, Low Value):**
- Nice to haves
- Do if you have spare cycles
- Don't prioritize over other quadrants

**Money Pits (High Effort, Low Value):**
- Don't build these
- Say no confidently
- Re-scope or kill

---

### Saying No Gracefully

**The Challenge:**
Everyone wants their feature prioritized. You can't build everything.

**Maya's "No" Framework:**

**1. Acknowledge the Request**
"I hear you. This would definitely help [specific use case]."

**2. Explain the Trade-Off**
"If we build this, we won't be able to build [other thing]. Here's why we're prioritizing [other thing]..."

**3. Share the Criteria**
"We're focusing on features that:
- Impact the most customers
- Solve critical pain points
- Align with our Q1 goals

This feature doesn't meet our bar right now."

**4. Offer Alternative**
"Here's a workaround you can use today..."
OR
"Let's revisit this in Q2 if we see more demand..."

**5. Stay Open**
"If you're hearing this from 10 customers, let me know. That changes the equation."

---

## PART 3: CUSTOMER RESEARCH

### Effective User Interviews

**Preparation:**

**Define Your Goals:**
- What do you want to learn?
- What decisions will this inform?
- What hypotheses are you testing?

**Recruit the Right People:**
- Mix of power users and casual users
- Include churned customers
- Buyers vs end users (interview both)

**Prepare Questions:**
- Open-ended
- Focused on problems, not solutions
- Non-leading

---

**The Interview Structure:**

**1. Warm-Up (5 min)**
- Build rapport
- Explain purpose
- Get them comfortable

**2. Context (10 min)**
- Their role and responsibilities
- Current workflows
- Tools they use

**3. Deep Dive (30 min)**
- Specific problem exploration
- Walk through current process
- Pain points and frustrations
- Attempted solutions

**4. Future State (10 min)**
- Ideal solution
- Must-haves vs nice-to-haves
- Trade-offs they'd accept

**5. Wrap-Up (5 min)**
- Anything we didn't cover?
- Other people we should talk to?
- Thank them

---

**Maya's Favorite Questions:**

**Problem Discovery:**
- "Walk me through the last time you [did this task]..."
- "What's the most frustrating part of [workflow]?"
- "How are you solving this today?"
- "What have you tried that didn't work?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing..."

**Solution Validation:**
- "Show me how you'd use this..."
- "What's missing from this?"
- "Would this solve your problem? Why or why not?"
- "How much time would this save you?"
- "Would you pay for this? How much?"

**Avoid These Questions:**
- ❌ "Would you use this feature?" (Everyone says yes)
- ❌ "Do you like this design?" (Not actionable)
- ❌ "What features do you want?" (They don't know)

---

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

**The Concept:**
Customers don't buy products. They "hire" products to do a job.

**The JTBD Formula:**
"When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

**Examples:**

**Bad (Feature-Focused):**
"Users want better analytics dashboards"

**Good (Job-Focused):**
"When I'm in a board meeting, I want to quickly show our customer health trends, so I can demonstrate our CS team's impact and get budget approval for expansion."

**The Job:**
- Situation: Board meeting
- Motivation: Show customer health trends quickly
- Outcome: Get budget approval

**The Solution:**
Build board-ready analytics views, not comprehensive dashboards.

---

## PART 4: PRODUCT-LED GROWTH

### The PLG Philosophy

**What Is Product-Led Growth?**
Your product is your primary growth driver. Users discover value before they talk to sales.

**PLG vs Sales-Led:**

**Sales-Led:**
- Marketing → Sales call → Demo → Contract → Onboard → Use product
- Long sales cycle
- High CAC
- Works for enterprise

**Product-Led:**
- Marketing → Sign up → Use product → Upgrade → Talk to sales (maybe)
- Short time-to-value
- Low CAC
- Works for SMB and self-serve

---

### Optimizing Onboarding

**The Goal:**
Get users to "aha moment" as fast as possible.

**The Aha Moment:**
The moment a user experiences the core value of your product.

**Examples:**
- **Slack:** Team sends first 2,000 messages
- **Dropbox:** User puts first file in folder and sees it sync
- **Renubu:** CS manager sees first automated health score update

**Measure:**
- Time to aha moment
- % of users reaching aha moment
- Correlation between aha moment and retention

---

**Onboarding Optimization:**

**1. Remove Friction**
- Reduce form fields
- Allow skip steps
- Pre-populate data where possible
- Show progress indicator

**2. Guide to Value**
- Progressive disclosure
- Show, don't tell
- Interactive tutorials > videos > docs
- Celebrate small wins

**3. Personalize the Path**
- Ask about role/use case
- Customize onboarding flow
- Show relevant examples
- Skip irrelevant steps

**4. Measure and Iterate**
- Where do users drop off?
- What steps take longest?
- What predicts activation?
- A/B test improvements

---

### Activation Metrics

**Activation = User experienced core value**

**Define Your Activation Criteria:**

**Example (Project Management Tool):**
- Created first project
- Invited at least 1 team member
- Created 3+ tasks
- Marked 1 task complete

**Users who do all 4 within 7 days:**
- 70% retain after 30 days
- 50% convert to paid

**Users who don't:**
- 10% retain after 30 days
- 5% convert to paid

**Strategy:**
Optimize onboarding to get users through these 4 steps.

---

## PART 5: PRODUCT-ENGINEERING ALIGNMENT

### Working with Engineering

**Common Friction Points:**

**Product says:** "Why is this taking so long?"
**Engineering says:** "You don't understand the technical complexity"

**Product says:** "We need to ship this now"
**Engineering says:** "We need time to do it right"

**Product says:** "Just build what I spec'd"
**Engineering says:** "That's not how it should work"

---

**Maya's Alignment Framework:**

**1. Include Engineering Early**
- Don't "throw specs over the wall"
- Collaborate on solution design
- Engineers have good ideas
- Build shared understanding

**2. Explain the Why**
- Share customer pain points
- Show usage data
- Explain business impact
- Help engineers understand context

**3. Be Flexible on How**
- Define the problem and outcome
- Let engineers design solution
- They know technical constraints
- Better solutions emerge

**4. Respect Estimates**
- Don't negotiate engineering effort
- Ask questions to understand
- Find scope trade-offs
- Build trust over time

**5. Celebrate Wins Together**
- Ship as a team
- Share customer feedback
- Credit engineering publicly
- Build team cohesion

---

### Sprint Planning Best Practices

**The Maya Sprint Structure:**

**Sprint Length:** 2 weeks

**Sprint Meetings:**

**Monday - Sprint Planning (2 hours)**
- Review priorities
- Break down stories
- Estimate effort
- Commit to sprint goals

**Daily - Standup (15 min)**
- What shipped yesterday
- What shipping today
- Blockers

**Friday - Sprint Review (1 hour)**
- Demo what shipped
- Gather feedback
- Discuss what's next

**Friday - Retrospective (30 min)**
- What went well
- What could improve
- Action items

---

**Healthy Sprint Metrics:**

- **Velocity:** Stable (not increasing or decreasing dramatically)
- **Scope creep:** <10% (don't change scope mid-sprint)
- **Carryover:** <20% (most stories complete)
- **Bugs:** Addressed same sprint when possible
