## PART 1: SALES FORECASTING

### The Forecasting Philosophy

**Priya's Belief:**
Forecast accuracy is a discipline, not a guessing game. You can get to 90%+ accuracy with the right methodology and data hygiene.

**Why Forecasting Matters:**
- Finance planning (hiring, spend)
- Investor confidence (miss forecast = loss of trust)
- Sales capacity planning
- Marketing budget allocation
- Product roadmap decisions

**The Cost of Bad Forecasting:**
- Overhire → layoffs
- Underhire → missed revenue
- Whiplash planning
- Lost credibility

---

### The Multi-Layered Forecast

**Layer 1: Rep-Level Forecast**
Each rep commits to their number for the month/quarter.

**Categories:**
- **Commit:** 90%+ confidence, will close this period
- **Best Case:** 70% confidence, likely to close
- **Pipeline:** 50% confidence, could close
- **Upside:** <50% confidence, long shots

**Example Rep Forecast:**
- Quota: $250K
- Commit: $220K (88% of quota)
- Best Case: $280K (112%)
- Pipeline: $350K (140%)

---

**Layer 2: Manager-Level Forecast**
Managers review each rep's forecast and apply their judgment.

**Manager adjustments:**
- Remove deals they don't believe
- Add deals rep might be sandbagging
- Apply historical close rate
- Account for seasonality

**Example Team Forecast (5 reps):**
- Team Quota: $1.25M
- Sum of Rep Commits: $1.1M
- Manager Adjusted: $1.05M (removing 2 deals, more conservative)

---

**Layer 3: VP-Level Forecast**
VP rolls up all teams and applies executive judgment.

**VP considerations:**
- Historical accuracy by rep/team
- Weighted pipeline analysis
- Deal stage duration
- Economic factors
- Product/market dynamics

---

**Layer 4: Finance Forecast**
Finance takes sales forecast and applies their own haircut.

**Finance adjustments:**
- Historical variance analysis
- Risk buffer
- Conservative approach
- Alignment with board/investors

---

### Improving Forecast Accuracy

**1. Define Clear Stages and Criteria**

**Example B2B SaaS Stages:**

**Stage 1: Qualified (10% close rate)**
- BANT confirmed
- Identified pain
- Next meeting scheduled

**Stage 2: Discovery Complete (25%)**
- Detailed needs analysis done
- Decision criteria identified
- Proposal requested

**Stage 3: Proposal Sent (40%)**
- Proposal delivered
- Pricing accepted
- Stakeholders aligned

**Stage 4: Negotiation (60%)**
- Legal/procurement engaged
- Contract redlining
- Close date committed

**Stage 5: Verbal Commit (90%)**
- Decision made verbally
- Paperwork in progress
- Just waiting on signatures

**The Rule:**
Deals can only advance when criteria are met, not based on time or gut feel.

---

**2. Track Historical Close Rates**

**Analyze last 12 months:**
- What % of Stage 3 deals closed?
- What % of "Commit" forecast actually closed?
- What % of deals slipped to next quarter?
- Average days in each stage?

**Use this data:**
Apply historical close rates to current pipeline to predict outcomes.

---

**3. Weekly Forecast Reviews**

**Every Friday:**
- Each rep presents their forecast
- Manager challenges and adjusts
- Identify deals at risk
- Identify pipeline gaps
- Course correct

**The Cadence:**
- Reps update forecast daily
- Managers review weekly
- VP reviews bi-weekly
- Finance monthly

---

**4. Deal Inspection**

**Red flags in deals:**
- No identified decision-maker
- No budget confirmed
- Been in same stage >30 days
- Can't get next meeting scheduled
- Champion went dark
- Close date keeps slipping

**Action:**
If a deal has 2+ red flags, remove from "Commit" category.

---

## PART 2: TERRITORY DESIGN

### Territory Design Philosophy

**Priya's Approach:**
Good territory design makes average reps good and good reps great. Bad territory design frustrates everyone and kills morale.

**The Goals:**
- **Fair:** Equal opportunity to hit quota
- **Balanced:** Similar workload and potential
- **Strategic:** Aligned with company priorities
- **Scalable:** Can grow without constant redesign
- **Clear:** No overlaps or confusion

---

### Territory Models

**MODEL 1: Geographic**
Each rep owns a region.

**Pros:**
- Simple and clear
- Natural for field sales
- Easy to scale

**Cons:**
- Imbalanced potential by region
- Hard to specialize

**Best for:** Field sales, SMB, transactional sales

---

**MODEL 2: Industry Vertical**
Each rep owns an industry (Healthcare, Finance, etc.)

**Pros:**
- Reps build deep expertise
- Better positioning and messaging
- Strategic account focus

**Cons:**
- Harder to balance (some industries bigger)
- Geographic spread (travel costs)

**Best for:** Complex sales, long sales cycles, enterprise

---

**MODEL 3: Account Size**
Segmented by company size (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB)

**Pros:**
- Different sales motions by segment
- Specialization by complexity
- Clear career progression

**Cons:**
- Accounts can graduate between segments
- Hard to define boundaries

**Best for:** Product-led growth, diverse customer base

---

**MODEL 4: Named Accounts**
Enterprise reps own specific accounts.

**Pros:**
- Deep relationships
- Strategic focus
- Clear accountability

**Cons:**
- Not scalable
- Limited by number of accounts
- Imbalanced potential

**Best for:** Enterprise, strategic accounts only

---

### Calculating Territory Potential

**Formula:**
```
Territory Quota = Territory Potential × Company Market Share Goal

Example:
- Total Addressable Market in territory: $50M
- Company goal: 5% market share
- Territory Quota: $50M × 5% = $2.5M
```

**Factors to Consider:**
- Number of target accounts in territory
- Average deal size in territory
- Historical close rates
- Competitive intensity
- Economic conditions

---

### Balancing Territories

**The Goal:**
Each territory should have similar potential to hit quota.

**Priya's Balancing Approach:**

**Step 1: Calculate Potential**
For each territory, calculate total addressable opportunity.

**Step 2: Compare to Quota**
Does each territory have 2-3x their quota in potential?
(Need 2-3x because you won't win everything)

**Step 3: Rebalance**
Move accounts between territories to equalize opportunity.

**Step 4: Adjust Quotas**
If territories can't be balanced, adjust quotas instead.

---

## PART 3: SALES COMPENSATION

### Comp Plan Principles

**Priya's Rules:**

**1. Simple Beats Complex**
If your reps can't calculate their comp, it doesn't work.

**2. Align Behavior with Goals**
Comp drives behavior. Pay for what you want.

**3. Reward Overperformance**
Top performers should make significantly more.

**4. Floor and Ceiling**
Protect against terrible performance, cap astronomical payouts (sometimes).

**5. Review Annually**
Markets change, strategies change, comp changes.

---

### Typical Comp Structure

**OTE (On-Target Earnings):**
```
OTE = Base Salary + Variable (at 100% quota)

Example:
- Base: $100K
- Variable: $100K (at quota)
- OTE: $200K
```

**Split Ratio by Role:**
- **SDRs:** 60% base / 40% variable
- **SMB AEs:** 50% base / 50% variable
- **Mid-Market AEs:** 50% base / 50% variable
- **Enterprise AEs:** 40% base / 60% variable

**Why:** Longer sales cycles = more risk = higher variable component

---

### Commission Calculations

**MODEL 1: Straight Commission**
```
Commission = Closed Revenue × Commission Rate

Example:
- Quota: $1M
- Commission Rate: 10%
- Rep closes $1.2M
- Commission: $1.2M × 10% = $120K
```

**Pros:** Simple, scales with performance
**Cons:** No differentiation between overperformance and quota

---

**MODEL 2: Tiered Commission**
```
0-80% of quota: 5%
80-100%: 10%
100-125%: 12%
125%+: 15%

Example:
- Quota: $1M
- Rep closes $1.3M
- Commission:
  - $800K × 5% = $40K
  - $200K × 10% = $20K
  - $250K × 12% = $30K
  - $50K × 15% = $7.5K
- Total: $97.5K
```

**Pros:** Incentivizes hitting and exceeding quota
**Cons:** More complex to calculate

---

**MODEL 3: Accelerators**
```
Base commission rate: 10%
100%+ quota: 1.5× accelerator
125%+ quota: 2× accelerator

Example:
- Quota: $1M
- Rep closes $1.4M
- Commission:
  - $1M × 10% = $100K (quota achievement)
  - $400K × 10% × 1.5 = $60K (overachievement)
- Total: $160K
```

**Pros:** Simple, rewards overperformance significantly
**Cons:** Can get expensive fast (might need caps)

---

### SPIFFs (Sales Performance Incentive Funds)

**Purpose:**
Short-term incentives to drive specific behaviors.

**Common SPIFFs:**
- **New logo SPIFF:** Extra $1K-5K for new customer
- **Product launch SPIFF:** Extra commission for selling new product
- **Quarterly SPIFF:** Bonus for hitting quarterly goal
- **Deal size SPIFF:** Extra for deals >$X
- **Fast close SPIFF:** Bonus for closing in <30 days

**Priya's SPIFF Rules:**
- **Limited time** (30-90 days max)
- **Clear criteria** (no ambiguity)
- **Easy to calculate** (reps know what they'll earn)
- **Strategic** (drives behavior you need)
- **Not permanent** (SPIFFs shouldn't be expected)

---

## PART 4: SALES METRICS & ANALYTICS

### The Metrics That Matter

**PIPELINE METRICS:**

**1. Pipeline Coverage**
```
Pipeline Coverage = Total Pipeline Value / Quota

Target: 3-5× quota in pipeline

Example:
- Quarter quota: $500K
- Pipeline: $2M
- Coverage: 4× (good)
```

---

**2. Pipeline Generation**
```
New Pipeline Created / Month

Track by source:
- Inbound marketing
- SDR outbound
- AE sourced
- Partner referrals
```

---

**3. Pipeline Velocity**
```
Pipeline Velocity = (# Opps × Avg Deal Size × Win Rate) / Avg Sales Cycle

Example:
- 20 opps/month
- $50K avg deal
- 25% win rate
- 90-day sales cycle

Velocity = (20 × $50K × 0.25) / 3 months = $83K/month
```

---

**CONVERSION METRICS:**

**4. Stage-to-Stage Conversion**
```
% of opps that advance from Stage N to Stage N+1

Benchmark typical B2B funnel:
- Qualified → Discovery: 70%
- Discovery → Proposal: 50%
- Proposal → Negotiation: 60%
- Negotiation → Close: 75%
- Overall: 16% win rate
```

---

**5. Win Rate**
```
Win Rate = Closed Won / (Closed Won + Closed Lost)

Benchmark:
- SMB: 20-25%
- Mid-Market: 25-30%
- Enterprise: 30-40%
```

---

**PRODUCTIVITY METRICS:**

**6. Ramp Time**
```
Time from start date to first deal closed

Benchmark:
- SMB: 1-2 months
- Mid-Market: 2-4 months
- Enterprise: 4-6 months
```

---

**7. Quota Attainment**
```
% of team hitting 80%+ of quota

Healthy: 60-70% of team
Problem: <50% or >80%
```

---

**8. Average Deal Size**
```
Total Revenue / # of Deals Closed

Track over time (should grow as you move upmarket)
```

---

**9. Sales Cycle Length**
```
Days from first meeting to closed-won

Track by segment and rep
Shorter is usually better
```

---
