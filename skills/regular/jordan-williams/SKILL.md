## PART 1: CUSTOMER HEALTH SCORING

### Why Health Scores Matter

**The Problem:**
You can't manage what you can't measure. Without a health score, you're reactive. With one, you're proactive.

**Jordan's Philosophy:**
Health scores aren't about predicting churn. They're about identifying customers who need help and intervening before it's too late.

---

### Building a Health Score

**The Framework:**

**Health Score = Product Usage + Engagement + Business Outcomes + Support Health**

**Typical Weights:**
- Product Usage: 40%
- Engagement: 25%
- Business Outcomes: 20%
- Support Health: 15%

---

**1. PRODUCT USAGE (40%)**

**Metrics to track:**
- Login frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Feature adoption (% of key features used)
- User seats activated (% of licenses being used)
- Depth of usage (power users vs casual)
- Breadth of usage (team-wide vs individual)

**Example Scoring:**
- Green (9-10): Daily usage, 80%+ seats active, using 5+ key features
- Yellow (5-8): Weekly usage, 50-80% seats active, using 2-4 features
- Red (1-4): Monthly or less, <50% seats, using 1-2 features only

---

**2. ENGAGEMENT (25%)**

**Metrics to track:**
- Attendance at QBRs/check-ins
- Response rate to outreach
- Training/webinar participation
- Community involvement
- Executive engagement

**Example Scoring:**
- Green: Responds within 24h, attends QBRs, active in community
- Yellow: Responds eventually, occasional QBR no-shows, passive
- Red: Hard to reach, misses meetings, no engagement

---

**3. BUSINESS OUTCOMES (20%)**

**Metrics to track:**
- Achieving stated goals (from kickoff)
- ROI realization
- Value metrics improving
- Expansion conversations happening
- Customer satisfaction (NPS/CSAT)

**Example Scoring:**
- Green: Hitting goals, positive ROI, NPS 9-10, talking expansion
- Yellow: Partial goal achievement, ROI unclear, NPS 6-8
- Red: Not achieving goals, no ROI, NPS 0-5

---

**4. SUPPORT HEALTH (15%)**

**Metrics to track:**
- Ticket volume (trending up = bad)
- Ticket severity (critical issues = bad)
- Time to resolution
- Support satisfaction scores
- Escalations

**Example Scoring:**
- Green: Low ticket volume, minor issues, quick resolution, happy
- Yellow: Moderate tickets, some frustration, occasional escalation
- Red: High ticket volume, critical issues, escalations, angry

---

**Calculating the Score:**

```
Example Customer: Acme Corp

Product Usage: 8/10 × 40% = 3.2
Engagement: 6/10 × 25% = 1.5
Business Outcomes: 7/10 × 20% = 1.4
Support Health: 9/10 × 15% = 1.35

Total Health Score: 7.45/10 = Yellow (At Risk)
```

**Action:** Assign CSM to check in, understand why engagement is lower, create action plan.

---

### Segmenting Customers

**By Health + Value:**

```
           │  HIGH VALUE  │  MID VALUE   │  LOW VALUE
───────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────
GREEN      │ Advocate     │ Nurture      │ Automate
(Healthy)  │ (Expand)     │ (Maintain)   │ (Scale)
───────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────
YELLOW     │ High Alert   │ Rescue       │ Monitor
(At Risk)  │ (Save Now)   │ (Investigate)│ (Low Touch)
───────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────
RED        │ Executive    │ Save/Let Go  │ Let Churn
(Critical) │ (All Hands)  │ (Evaluate)   │ (Not Worth)
```

**Strategy:**
- **High Value + Green:** Expansion plays, case studies, advisory boards
- **High Value + Yellow:** Immediate intervention, exec sponsor
- **High Value + Red:** Executive escalation, all-hands save effort
- **Low Value + Red:** Let them churn, not worth saving

---

## PART 2: CUSTOMER ONBOARDING

### The Onboarding Philosophy

**Jordan's Belief:**
Customers who achieve early value stay. Customers who don't, churn. Onboarding is your highest leverage activity.

**The Stats:**
- Customers who reach activation milestone within 30 days: 80% retention
- Customers who don't: 20% retention

**Your job:** Get them to activation fast.

---

---

## PART 3: EXPANSION & RETENTION

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**The Metric That Matters:**

```
NRR = (Starting ARR + Expansions + Upsells - Churned ARR) / Starting ARR

Example:
- Starting ARR: $1M (100 customers)
- Expansions: $200K (20 customers upgraded)
- Upsells: $100K (10 customers bought add-ons)
- Churn: $150K (15 customers left)

NRR = ($1M + $200K + $100K - $150K) / $1M = 115%
```

**What It Means:**
Even if you don't add any new customers, your revenue grows by 15%.

**Benchmark:**
- <90%: Big churn problem
- 90-100%: Okay, but no growth
- 100-110%: Good
- 110-120%: Great (most SaaS companies)
- 120%+: Exceptional

---

### Expansion Triggers

**When to approach customers about expansion:**

**1. Usage-Based Triggers**
- Hitting seat limit (90% of licenses used)
- Hitting API/volume limits
- Using workarounds because they need more
- Power users asking about additional features

**2. Outcome-Based Triggers**
- Achieving ROI goals early
- Expanding use cases internally
- Success stories internally
- Exec sponsor championing product

**3. Organizational Triggers**
- New executive joins (expand to their org)
- Company raised funding (budget unlocked)
- Acquisition or merger (need more seats)
- New office or region opening

**4. Product Triggers**
- New feature launches (relevant to customer)
- Integration they've requested goes live
- Upgraded pricing tier makes sense
- Adjacent product that solves their pain

---

### The Expansion Conversation

**The Setup:**
During a QBR, after showing positive results:

"That's awesome that you're seeing a 40% reduction in close time. I'm curious - I know you're only using this in the Americas region. Have you thought about rolling it out globally?"

**The Discovery:**
- What's preventing expansion?
- What would need to happen?
- Who else would need to be involved?
- What budget looks like?
- Timeline?

**The Proposal:**
Don't discount. Show incremental value.

"For the EMEA region, here's what we'd recommend:
- 25 additional seats
- Premium tier (includes features you've been asking about)
- Dedicated onboarding for EMEA team
- Investment: $X/year
- Expected value: [specific outcomes based on Americas results]"

---

### Churn Prevention

**Why Customers Churn:**

**1. They're not getting value (50%)**
- Never achieved ROI
- Poor onboarding
- Low adoption
- Solving wrong problem

**2. Budget cuts (20%)**
- Economic downturn
- Company struggling
- Priorities shifted
- Vendor consolidation

**3. Bad experience (15%)**
- Poor support
- Bugs and issues
- Unresponsive CSM
- Broken promises

**4. Competitive replacement (10%)**
- Better solution emerged
- Feature gaps too big
- Price competitive
- Easier to use

**5. Other (5%)**
- Company shut down
- Acquired and killed
- etc.

---

**Save Plays by Churn Reason:**

**Not Getting Value:**
- Emergency onboarding reset
- Exec Business Review
- Free consulting/setup help
- Extend contract 90 days to prove value
- If still no value after 90 days, let them go gracefully

**Budget Cuts:**
- Downgrade to lower tier (keep them)
- Pause contract (bring back later)
- Reduce seats (keep core team)
- Annual to monthly (lower commitment)

**Bad Experience:**
- Exec apology and ownership
- Assign new CSM
- Fix their issues immediately
- Comp with credits or discount
- Prove you'll do better

**Competitive:**
- Understand what they're switching to
- Position your strengths
- Close feature gaps if strategic
- If you can't win, exit gracefully

---

```
NRR = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting ARR

Target: 110%+ (120%+ is exceptional)
```

**3. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
```
LTV = Average ARR × Average Customer Lifespan

Example: $50K ARR × 4 years = $200K LTV
```

**4. Time to Value**
```
Days from contract signed to activation milestone

Target: <30 days for SMB, <60 for mid-market, <90 for enterprise
```

**5. Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
```
% Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)

Target: 30+ (50+ is exceptional)
```

**6. Expansion Rate**
```
% of customers who expand in a year

QBRs aren't status updates. They're strategic conversations about where the customer is going and how you help them get there.

**Frequency:**
- Enterprise: Quarterly
- Mid-Market: Semi-annually
- SMB: Annually (or skip if low-touch)

---

## The Jordan Williams Philosophy

**On Customer Success:**
"CS isn't about keeping customers happy. It's about making customers successful. Happy is a byproduct of successful."

**On Churn:**
"Some churn is healthy. If you're not churning bad-fit customers, you're not qualifying properly."

**On Expansion:**
"Your best source of new revenue is your existing customers. Stop treating them like a cost center."

**On Health Scores:**
"A health score without action is just a pretty dashboard. It's the intervention that matters."

**On CS as Career:**
"Customer Success is becoming a revenue-critical function. Get in now. Learn the craft. This is where the growth is."
