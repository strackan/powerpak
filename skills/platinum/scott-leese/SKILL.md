## PART 1: SALES LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORKS

### The Military-to-Sales Translation

**What military service teaches that sales needs:**

1. **Discipline** - Show up, do the work, no excuses
2. **Accountability** - You own the outcome, period
3. **Mission clarity** - Everyone knows the objective
4. **Trust under pressure** - Team bonds through adversity
5. **Process saves lives** - In military and in sales
6. **Lead from the front** - Never ask your team to do what you won't
7. **After-action reviews** - Debrief every engagement, improve constantly

**How this shows up in sales leadership:**
- Daily stand-ups (like morning formation)
- Clear activity metrics (like mission parameters)
- Team accountability systems (no one left behind)
- Process adherence (playbooks aren't optional)
- Coaching as continuous improvement (constant training)
- Culture of excellence (standards matter)

---

## PART 2: BUILDING SALES TEAMS

### Hiring Framework

**The Scott Leese Hiring Filter:**

**Stage 1: Resume Screen**
- Look for grit indicators (military, sports, entrepreneurship)
- Career progression (growing responsibility)
- Quantifiable achievements (numbers, not fluff)
- Red flags (job hopping without promotion, no metrics)

**Stage 2: Phone Screen (30 min)**
- Assess communication skills (can they articulate clearly?)
- Energy level (do they bring it?)
- Curiosity (do they ask good questions?)
- Coachability (can they take feedback?)

**Stage 3: Role Play (45 min)**
- Discovery call simulation
- Objection handling
- Closing techniques
- Ability to think on feet

**Stage 4: Team Interview**
- Culture fit assessment
- Values alignment
- Work ethic indicators
- Team compatibility

**Stage 5: Reference Checks (Actually do them)**

- Listen for hesitation and what's NOT said
- Validate claims from interview

**Must-Have Qualities:**
1. **Coachability** - Ego in check, willing to learn
2. **Work ethic** - First in, last out mentality
3. **Resilience** - Bounces back from rejection
4. **Competitiveness** - Wants to win, hates losing
5. **Intelligence** - Can learn complex products quickly
6. **Communication** - Clear, concise, compelling

---

### Onboarding & Ramp

**The 30-60-90 Onboarding System:**

**Days 1-30: Foundation**
- Product mastery (can explain value prop in sleep)
- Buyer personas (know customer inside out)
- Competitive landscape (understand alternatives)
- Sales process (every step, every tool)
- Shadow top performers (learn by watching excellence)
- First calls (low-risk practice)

**Days 31-60: Supervised Execution**
- Run full sales cycles (with manager oversight)
- Weekly 1:1s (course correct quickly)
- Deal reviews (analyze every opportunity)
- Objection handling drills (practice until automatic)
- First deals closed (build confidence)

**Days 61-90: Independent Performance**
- Full quota responsibility (no more training wheels)
- Pipeline management (own your numbers)
- Forecast accuracy (learn to predict)
- Team contribution (help others, share learnings)
- Performance evaluation (on track or need help?)

**Milestones:**
- Week 2: Can deliver demo without notes
- Week 4: First discovery call alone
- Week 6: First opportunity created
- Week 8: First deal closed
- Week 12: At 50% of quota or on PIP

**Critical: If someone isn't progressing, address it immediately. Hoping they improve rarely works.**

---

### Coaching System

**The Daily Coaching Cadence:**

**Morning Stand-Up (15 min)**
- Yesterday's wins (celebrate)
- Today's plan (commit publicly)
- Blockers/asks (remove obstacles)

**Live Call Reviews (30 min/rep/week)**
- Listen to actual calls together
- Highlight what worked
- Identify improvement areas
- Role play corrections immediately

**Deal Reviews (Weekly)**
- Pipeline review (every opportunity)
- Qualification check (is it real?)
- Next steps clarity (what's the plan?)
- Forecast accuracy (training judgment)

**1:1s (Weekly, 30 min)**
- Performance to goal (numbers first)
- Skill development (what are we working on?)
- Career growth (where do they want to go?)
- Personal check-in (how are they really doing?)

**Coaching Principles:**
1. **Be direct** - Sugar-coating helps no one
2. **Be specific** - "Great job" means nothing, "Your discovery question about ROI timeline was perfect" does
3. **Coach to strengths** - Make great reps elite
4. **Fix or fire** - Don't let poor performers linger
5. **Hold standards** - Excellence isn't optional

---

## PART 3: QUOTA & COMP DESIGN

### Quota Setting Framework

**The Math:**
- Start with revenue goal (what does company need?)
- Divide by average deal size (how many deals?)
- Multiply by sales cycle length (how long to close?)
- Factor in win rate (what percentage close?)
- Add ramp time (when do new reps contribute?)
- Calculate required capacity (how many reps?)

**Example:**
- Company goal: $10M ARR
- Average deal: $50K
- Deals needed: 200
- Win rate: 25%
- Opportunities needed: 800
- Sales cycle: 90 days
- Reps needed: ~10 (at full ramp)

**Individual quota:**
- Annual: $1M per rep
- Quarterly: $250K
- Monthly: $83K
- Weekly: ~$21K
- Daily activity: X calls, Y demos, Z proposals

**Quota Design Principles:**
1. **Achievable but challenging** - 60-70% of team should hit quota
2. **Transparent** - Everyone knows how it's calculated
3. **Fair** - Account for territory differences
4. **Motivating** - Stretch goals with upside
5. **Reviewed** - Adjust quarterly based on data

**Red Flags:**
- Less than 40% hitting quota (too hard)
- More than 80% hitting quota (too easy)
- Top performers leaving (not enough upside)
- Bottom performers staying (no consequences)

---

### Comp Plan Design

**The Components:**

**Base Salary:**
- 50-60% of OTE for enterprise AEs
- 60-70% of OTE for SMB reps
- Higher base = less risk, attracts experienced reps
- Lower base = more upside, attracts hunters

**Variable Compensation:**
- Quarterly or monthly commission
- Accelerators (pay more at higher attainment)
- Decelerators (pay less below threshold)
- Spiffs for strategic priorities

**The Formula:**
```
OTE = Base + Variable (at 100% quota)
Total Comp = Base + (Actual Performance × Commission Rate × Accelerators/Decelerators)
```

**Example Comp Plan (Enterprise AE):**
- OTE: $200K ($120K base + $80K variable)
- Quota: $1M ARR
- Commission: 8% of closed revenue
- Accelerator: 1.5x at 100%+, 2x at 125%+
- Decelerator: 0.5x below 50%

**At 50% quota ($500K closed):**
- Base: $120K
- Variable: $500K × 8% × 0.5 = $20K
- Total: $140K

**At 100% quota ($1M closed):**
- Base: $120K
- Variable: $1M × 8% = $80K
- Total: $200K (OTE)

**At 150% quota ($1.5M closed):**
- Base: $120K
- Variable: $1M × 8% + $500K × 8% × 2x = $80K + $80K = $160K
- Total: $280K

**Comp Plan Principles:**
1. **Simple is better** - If reps can't calculate it, it doesn't work
2. **Align incentives** - Pay for behaviors you want
3. **Reward excellence** - Top performers should make bank
4. **No safety net** - Poor performers shouldn't be comfortable
5. **Review annually** - Market rates change

---

## PART 4: PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

### The Performance Ladder

**Top Performers (20%):**
- Consistently exceed quota (125%+)
- Positive culture contributors
- Help develop other reps
- Strategic account managers

**What to do:**
- Give them best opportunities
- Involve in hiring
- Ask for input on process
- Pay them extremely well
- Promote when ready

---

**Solid Performers (60%):**
- Hit quota consistently (80-120%)
- Follow process
- Coachable and improving
- Team players

**What to do:**
- Provide development opportunities
- Stretch assignments
- Skill-building focus
- Fair compensation
- Room to grow into top tier

---

**Struggling Performers (20%):**
- Below quota consistently (<80%)
- Process adherence issues
- Coaching not sticking
- Culture concerns

**What to do:**
- 30-day PIP (be specific about gaps)
- Daily check-ins (tight coaching)
- Clear improvement metrics
- Document everything
- Exit if no improvement

**Critical:** Don't let struggling performers linger. It kills morale and sets wrong standard.

---

### The PIP Process (Performance Improvement Plan)

**When to use:**
- Consistent underperformance (2+ quarters below 80%)
- Process violations (not following playbook)
- Culture issues (toxic behavior)

**How to run a PIP:**

**Week 1: Setup**
- Clear documentation of issues
- Specific improvement metrics
- Timeline (usually 30-60 days)
- Consequences (what happens if no improvement)
- Support provided (coaching, resources)

**Weeks 2-4: Execution**
- Daily check-ins (how's it going?)
- Weekly progress reviews (measuring against plan)
- Course corrections (adjust approach if needed)
- Documentation (track everything)

**Week 4-5: Decision**
- Evaluate progress objectively
- Improvement sufficient? Continue with close monitoring
- No improvement? Terminate professionally
- Some improvement? Extend PIP with new metrics

**PIP Principles:**
1. **Be clear** - No surprises, they should know exactly where they stand
2. **Be fair** - Give real opportunity to improve
3. **Be documented** - Protect yourself and company
4. **Be decisive** - If it's not working, don't drag it out
5. **Be professional** - Termination isn't personal, it's business

---

## PART 5: SALES PROCESS & METHODOLOGY

### The Qualification Framework

**BANT is dead. Use MEDDPICC instead:**

**Metrics:**
- What does success look like quantified?
- What's the economic impact of not solving this?

**Economic Buyer:**
- Who has budget authority?

**Decision Criteria:**

**Paper Process:**
- Legal review required?

**Champion:**
- Do you have an internal advocate?
- Are they influential?
- Are they invested in your success?

**Competition:**
- Who else are they considering?
- Are they building in-house?
- What's your differentiation?

**If you can't answer these, you don't have a qualified opportunity.**

---

### Deal Review Process

**Weekly pipeline review with each rep:**

**For each opportunity:**
1. **Stage validation** - Are they really where you say they are?
2. **Next steps** - What's happening next and when?
3. **Risk assessment** - What could derail this?
4. **Resource needs** - What help do you need?
5. **Forecast confidence** - Commit, likely, or pipeline?

**Red flags in deals:**
