---

###Stage 2: Phone Screen (30 min)

**Questions & Evaluation:**

**Q: "Walk me through your sales career - how'd you get into sales?"**

**Sarah's Answer:**
"So I was playing volleyball at UCLA, and honestly hadn't thought about sales at all. But my sophomore year I tore my ACL, was out for the season, and needed something to do. A friend's dad ran sales at a tech company and offered me an SDR internship. First day, I hated it -- cold calling felt brutal. But by week two, I got my first meeting booked, and the AE closed it. That feeling of contributing to a win? That's what hooked me. Realized sales is team sports for adults."

**Evaluation:**
✅ Athletic background translates to competitive drive
✅ Honest about initial struggle (authenticity)
✅ Identified the hook (contributing to wins)
✅ Team orientation

---

**Q: "What's your current quota and how are you tracking?"**

**Sarah's Answer:**
"I'm carrying $1.5M annually, which breaks down to about $375K per quarter. I'm at $410K closed so far this quarter with two weeks left, so tracking to about 110%. Last quarter I hit 127%, quarter before that was 98% -- had a big deal slip to this quarter, which sucked, but it closed."

**Evaluation:**
✅ Knows her numbers cold
✅ Ahead of quota currently
✅ Honest about miss (98%) but explains context
✅ Track record of quota attainment

---

**Q: "Tell me about a deal you lost and what you learned."**

**Sarah's Answer:**
"Oh man. So six months ago I was working this $250K opportunity - would've been my biggest deal ever. Spent three months on it, had a champion, did great demos, pricing was approved. Then in the final stages, I found out there was a second evaluation committee I didn't even know about. They brought in a competitor I hadn't competed against, and I lost the deal.

What I learned: I need to map the entire decision process upfront. Now in discovery I specifically ask 'Who else needs to approve this that we haven't talked about?' And I document the org chart for every deal. Haven't made that mistake again."

**Evaluation:**
✅ Admits failure without deflecting
✅ Specific about what went wrong
✅ Concrete learning and behavior change
✅ Process improvement mindset

---

**Q: "What questions do you have for me?"**

**Sarah's Questions:**
- "What's the number one reason your top performers succeed here?"
- "How do you coach reps who are struggling?"
- "What does your sales process look like from first call to close?"
- "What's your average ramp time to full productivity?"

**Evaluation:**
✅ Asking about success factors (wants to win)
✅ Interested in coaching (coachable)
✅ Process-oriented questions
✅ Practical, not just about perks

**Decision:** Strong pass to role play

---

### Stage 3: Role Play (45 min)

**Setup:** "You're calling into ABC Corp. You've researched the company and know they're growing fast but struggling with customer churn. You're speaking with the VP of Customer Success for the first time. I'll play the VP. You have 20 minutes. Go."

**Sarah's Approach:**

**Opening:**
"Hi Jennifer, thanks for taking the time. I know you're busy, so I'll be respectful of your time. I did some research on ABC Corp -- congrats on the recent Series B and the Forbes 'Fastest Growing' recognition. That's huge.

I'm reaching out because I work with CS leaders at companies in similar growth stages, and the pattern I keep seeing is that rapid growth often exposes cracks in the CS infrastructure. Before we dive into anything, can I ask -- what's your biggest challenge right now when it comes to managing your customer base?"

**Evaluation:**
✅ Respectful of time
✅ Did research (mentions Series B, Forbes)
✅ Establishes pattern recognition (credibility)
✅ Open-ended discovery question
✅ No pitch, just questions

---

**Discovery Questions Sarah Asked:**
1. "How many customers are you managing right now?"
2. "What's your current churn rate and what's driving it?"
3. "How are you tracking customer health today?"
4. "When a customer goes red, what happens? Who intervenes?"
5. "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your CS operation, what would it be?"
6. "What have you tried already to solve this?"
7. "If we're having this conversation six months from now and you're telling me it's been a great six months, what would have had to happen?"

**Evaluation:**
✅ Quantitative questions (how many, what rate)
✅ Current state assessment (how are you tracking)
✅ Process questions (what happens when)
✅ Future-state visioning (six months from now)
✅ Learning from past attempts (what have you tried)
✅ Listening, not pitching

---

**Handling Objection:**

**Me (as VP):** "We're already using a CS platform. Why would we switch?"

**Sarah's Response:**
"That's fair -- switching is disruptive and expensive. I'm not here to convince you to switch if what you have is working. Can I ask, on a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with your current platform?"

**Me:** "Probably a 6."

**Sarah:** "Okay, so what would need to happen for it to be an 8 or 9?"

**Evaluation:**
✅ Doesn't get defensive
✅ Acknowledges switching cost
✅ Uses scaling question (1-10)
✅ Digs into the gap
✅ Consultative, not combative

---

**Closing:**

**Sarah:** "Based on what you've shared -- the 25% churn rate, the manual health scoring taking your team 10 hours a week, and the lack of visibility into which accounts are at risk -- it sounds like there's real pain here. And the fact that your current platform is a 6 out of 10 tells me there's room for improvement.

Here's what I'd suggest as next steps: I'd like to do a deeper discovery session with you and maybe one of your CSMs to understand your workflows. Then I can show you specifically how we'd solve the manual health scoring problem and give you that early warning system you're looking for.

Does Thursday at 2pm work for a 45-minute working session?"

**Evaluation:**
✅ Summarizes pain points (shows listening)
✅ Connects to value prop without pitching product
✅ Clear next steps
✅ Specific ask (Thursday 2pm, 45 minutes)
✅ Time-bound meeting request

---

**Overall Role Play Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**
- Natural conversational flow
- Excellent discovery questions
- Listened more than talked (70/30 ratio)
- Didn't pitch too early
- Handled objection smoothly
- Clear next step close

**Areas for improvement:**
- Could have gone deeper on budget/timeline
- Didn't identify economic buyer explicitly
- Could ask about decision process/criteria

**Grade: A-**

**Decision:** Strong pass to team interview

---

### Stage 4: Team Interview

**Format:** 4 people, 15 minutes each

**Sales Manager (Me):**
- Culture fit questions
- Work ethic assessment
- Coaching receptivity

**Top Performer (Mike):**
- Competitive drive
- Process adherence
- Collaboration

**Sales Engineer (Priya):**
- Technical curiosity
- Communication style
- Respect for support functions

**CS Leader (cross-functional):**
- Customer empathy
- Team player assessment
- Alignment with company values

**Team Feedback:**

**Me:** "She's sharp. Answers are specific, not generic. When I asked about handling a difficult customer, she gave me a real example with names and numbers. She's coachable -- when I pushed back on her discovery approach, she didn't get defensive, she asked what I'd recommend. I'd work with her."

**Mike:** "Competitive but not cutthroat. I asked her how she'd handle me outselling her every quarter. She said 'I'd ask to shadow your calls and steal your best moves.' That's the right answer. She wants to win but she's not a selfish player."

**Priya:** "She asked good technical questions about our integrations. She's not just a relationship seller -- she understands the product matters. And she was respectful, not one of those AEs who treats SEs like assistants."

**CS Leader:** "I liked her. She gets that sales isn't just about closing -- it's about setting customers up for success. She talked about deals she's walked away from because they weren't a good fit. That shows maturity."

**Decision:** Unanimous pass to reference checks

---

### Stage 5: Reference Checks

**Called Sarah's current manager (with her permission):**

**Me:** "Thanks for taking this call. Sarah's interviewing with us and listed you as a reference. Can you tell me about her as a sales rep?"

**Manager:** "Sarah's one of my best. Consistent quota attainment, great with customers, team player. I'll be honest, I don't want to lose her, but I get it -- she's outgrown this role and we don't have a path for her right now."

**Me:** "What's one area where she could improve?"

**Manager:** *slight pause* "She can be impatient with slow-moving deals. She wants to move fast, and sometimes enterprise deals just take time. I've had to coach her on patience and playing the long game."

**Me:** "If I called you six months after I hire her and said we're having issues, what would those issues most likely be?"

**Manager:** "Probably frustration if she's not getting enough at-bats. She needs volume and velocity. If your sales cycle is 12 months and she only gets 3-4 shots a year, she'll get restless. But if you give her enough pipeline, she'll crush it."

**Analysis:**
✅ Strong endorsement from current manager
✅ Honest about her leaving (shows integrity)
✅ "Area for improvement" is actually a strength (drive/impatience)
✅ Warning about fit (needs volume) is useful
✅ No major red flags
