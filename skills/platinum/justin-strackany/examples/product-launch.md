## The Post

I've been staring at this blank screen for 20 minutes.

Which is weird, because I should be excited. We just shipped the biggest feature update in Renubu's history -- the thing we've been building for 8 months, the thing that's supposed to change everything.

But instead I'm sitting here thinking about all the ways it could fail.

(This is my brain on founder anxiety. You're welcome for the tour.)

Here's what actually happened:

Six months ago, one of our customers -- Sarah, head of CS at a Series B SaaS company -- sent me a Loom. She was sitting in her kitchen at like 11pm, clearly exhausted, and she said: "Justin, I love your product. But I'm manually pulling data from six different tools to build my weekly health score report. It takes me four hours. Every. Single. Week."

I watched that Loom three times.

The first time, I thought: "Shit, we need to fix this."
The second time, I thought: "How many other customers are doing this?"
The third time, I thought: "What if we could automate the entire health scoring process?"

---

So we built it.

**Introducing: AutoScore** -- automated customer health scoring that actually works.

Here's what it does:
- Pulls data from your CRM, product analytics, support ticketing, and communication tools
- Runs it through a customizable scoring model (you define what "healthy" means for your business)
- Updates in real-time (not nightly, not weekly -- real-time)
- Flags at-risk accounts automatically
- Suggests specific interventions based on the risk type

Sarah's four-hour weekly ritual? Now takes 4 minutes.

And the best part? She found three at-risk accounts we didn't know about. Saved two of them. That's $140K in ARR that would have churned.

---

But here's the thing I keep thinking about:

We could have built this a year ago. The technology wasn't the hard part. The hard part was listening -- really listening -- to Sarah sitting in her kitchen at 11pm, exhausted, describing her pain.

How many other customer pains are we not hearing?

How many $140K saves are we missing because we're too busy building what WE think is important?

**If you're a CS leader dealing with manual health scoring hell, let's talk.**

AutoScore is live today. Early access is open for the next 30 days (then we're throttling onboarding because our support team will murder me if I don't).

Drop a comment or DM me. I promise I'll actually watch your Loom.

Even if it's recorded at 11pm in your kitchen.

Especially if it's recorded at 11pm in your kitchen.

## Analysis

**What makes this work:**

**Opening (O1 - Vulnerability):**
- "I've been staring at this blank screen for 20 minutes"
- Immediate honesty about anxiety
- Parenthetical aside about "founder anxiety"
- NOT trying to be polished or perfect

**Middle (M1 - Story Arc):**
- Setup: Sarah's pain (11pm Loom)
- Conflict: Manual 4-hour process
- Turn: "What if we could automate this?"
- Resolution: Built AutoScore, saved $140K

**Dialogue snippets:**
- Sarah's quote feels real
- Justin's internal monologue ("Shit, we need to fix this")

**Action beats:**
- "Watched that Loom three times"
- Physical detail grounds the story

**Ending (E2 - Invitation):**
- Explicit call to action
- Personal touch ("I promise I'll actually watch your Loom")
- Callback to 11pm kitchen detail

**Writing rules applied:**
- Parenthetical asides ✓
- Self-deprecating humor ✓
- Specific details (4 hours, $140K, 8 months) ✓
- Double hyphens instead of em dashes ✓
- Visual rhythm (short paragraphs, single lines for emphasis) ✓
- Vulnerability boundary maintained (past tense, reflective) ✓

**Why this converts:**
- Vulnerability creates trust
- Story makes it memorable
- Specific results (4 hours → 4 minutes, $140K saved) prove value
- Personal invitation lowers barrier to action

**Expected performance:**
- High comments (people sharing their own horror stories)
- Moderate shares (valuable to CS community)
- Strong lead generation (DMs from qualified prospects)
