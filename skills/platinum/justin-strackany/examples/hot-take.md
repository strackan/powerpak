## The Post

What if "customer success" is actually making your customers less successful?

Hear me out.

---

I was on a call last week with a CS leader at a $50M ARR company. She's got a team of 15, beautiful playbooks, automated health scoring (yes, including ours), and NPS in the 40s.

And she's miserable.

"Justin," she said, "we're so busy making sure customers don't churn that we've stopped helping them actually succeed."

That sentence has been rattling around my brain for five days.

---

Here's what I think is happening:

**Customer Success** has become **Churn Prevention Theater**.

We've turned it into a reactive discipline:
- Wait for health score to drop
- Run the save play
- Offer a discount or training or "executive engagement"
- Mark them green
- Move to the next fire

Meanwhile, the customer is sitting there thinking: "Cool, I didn't cancel. But I'm still not getting the outcomes I was promised."

---

This isn't really about customer success.

It's about what happens when we optimize for the wrong metric.

We measure churn because it's easy to measure. It's a yes/no question. Did they cancel? No? Great, you're a good CS leader.

But **success** isn't the opposite of **churn**.

Success is: Did the customer achieve the business outcome they hired your product to deliver?

And that's hard to measure. It requires you to actually know what outcome they wanted. It requires ongoing conversations about whether they're getting there. It requires admitting when your product ISN'T the right fit (and gracefully helping them find what is).

It requires being okay with some healthy churn.

---

I think we've built an entire industry on the wrong foundation.

We hired "Customer Success Managers" and gave them quota to hit on renewals and expansions. Then we wonder why they act like salespeople instead of success partners.

We built "health scores" that measure product usage, not business outcomes. Then we wonder why customers with "green" health scores still churn.

We created "playbooks" for every scenario. Then we wonder why interactions feel robotic and customers complain that "no one actually listens."

---

**Here's what I think we should do instead:**

1. **Rename the function** - Call it what it actually is: Revenue Retention. Or don't call it Customer Success if success isn't what you're measuring.

2. **Separate success from sales** - If someone's job is to help customers succeed, don't tie their comp to renewal rates. Those are different jobs. Hire different people.

3. **Measure outcomes, not activity** - Stop tracking "quarterly business reviews completed" and start tracking "customers who achieved their stated goals."

4. **Be okay with healthy churn** - If a customer isn't getting value and your product isn't the right fit, help them leave. Gracefully. Your brand and your team's sanity will thank you.

5. **Hire for curiosity, not process** - The best CS people I've ever worked with were relentlessly curious about customer problems. The worst were really good at following playbooks.

---

This is going to piss people off.

I'm going to get comments telling me I "don't understand enterprise," or that "renewals are a lagging indicator of success," or that "not all companies can afford to let customers churn."

And maybe they're right.

But I keep thinking about that CS leader -- brilliant, hardworking, burnt out -- who said: "We're so busy preventing churn that we've stopped creating success."

If that doesn't haunt you, I don't know what will.

---

**What do you think?**

Am I completely wrong here? Is there a way to make Customer Success about actual success instead of churn theater?

Drop a comment. Tell me I'm an idiot. Or tell me you're feeling this too.

I genuinely want to know.

## Analysis

**What makes this controversial:**

**Opening (O5 - Provocative Question):**
- "What if 'customer success' is actually making your customers less successful?"
- Immediately challenges the core premise of an entire profession
- "Hear me out" signals you know this is going to ruffle feathers

**Middle (M2 - Philosophical Escalation):**
- Starts specific: One CS leader's quote
- Zooms to pattern: "Churn Prevention Theater"
- Escalates to universal: "We've built an entire industry on the wrong foundation"
- Each zoom level adds weight

**Evidence:**
- Specific anecdote (the call last week)
- Industry-wide observations (health scores, playbooks, comp structures)
- Personal experience (20+ years)

**Ending (E5 - Redirect/Application):**
- 5 specific, actionable recommendations
- Acknowledges pushback preemptively
- Returns to emotional hook (burnt out CS leader)
- Genuine open question (not rhetorical)

**Writing rules applied:**
- Provocative without being mean ✓
- Self-aware about controversy ✓
- Specific details ($50M ARR, team of 15, NPS 40s) ✓
- Double hyphens ✓
- Parenthetical asides ✓
- Short punchy sentences for emphasis ✓

**Controversial elements:**
1. "Churn Prevention Theater" - Harsh framing
2. "We've built an entire industry on the wrong foundation" - Big claim
3. "Rename the function" - Actionable but radical
4. "Be okay with healthy churn" - Counterintuitive in SaaS

**Why this works:**
- Based on real insight (not just contrarian for clicks)
- Offers solutions (not just criticism)
- Acknowledges complexity
- Invites disagreement
- Taps into felt frustration in the industry

**Expected performance:**
- Very high engagement (100+ comments)
- Polarizing reactions (some love it, some hate it)
- High shares from people who agree
- Sparks genuine debate in comments
- Positions Justin as thought leader willing to challenge orthodoxy

**Follow-up opportunities:**
- Case study of company that tried this
- Interview with that CS leader
- Data on "healthy churn" companies vs churn-at-all-costs companies
- Workshop on measuring customer outcomes vs activity

**Risks:**
- Could alienate CS professionals
- Oversimplifies complex topic
- Might come across as preachy

**Mitigation:**
- Ending acknowledges he might be wrong
- Personal story humanizes the critique
- Solutions show he's thought deeply about this
- Genuine curiosity in the ask
