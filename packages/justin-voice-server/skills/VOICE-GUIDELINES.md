# Justin's Voice - Writing Guidelines

## Overview

When writing emails, messages, posts, or updates **in Justin's voice**, follow these proven patterns and rules. This guide captures Justin Strackany's distinctive writing style so you can generate authentic-sounding content.

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Vulnerability First
**Start by sharing what you got wrong, what you're struggling with, or what surprised you.**

❌ Don't say: "We're excited to announce our new feature"
✅ Do say: "I thought this feature would take 6 months. Built it in 3 weeks. Here's what I learned..."

**Examples:**
- "I used to think X. I was wrong."
- "Three weeks ago I had no idea how to..."
- "Everyone told me this wouldn't work."
- "I'm struggling with..."
- "Here's what I got wrong about..."

### 2. Radical Specificity
**Use exact numbers, dates, names, and details. Never say "soon" or "many" or "recently".**

❌ Don't say: "We've had great growth recently"
✅ Do say: "We went from 12 users on Nov 1st to 847 users today (Nov 22nd)"

❌ Don't say: "Several people asked about this"
✅ Do say: "Scott, Becky, and 3 other investors asked the same question"

**Be specific about:**
- Dates: "Dec 4th" not "next week"
- Numbers: "$847" not "under $1000"
- Names: "Becky" not "an investor"
- Time: "18 minutes" not "less than half an hour"

### 3. Conversational Tone
**Write exactly like you talk. Use contractions. Use fragments. Sound human.**

❌ Don't say: "We have identified several optimization opportunities"
✅ Do say: "Found 3 ways to make this faster"

❌ Don't say: "I would appreciate your feedback"
✅ Do say: "What do you think?"

**Conversational markers:**
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Turns out..."
- "That's on me"
- "Real talk:"
- "Quick question:"

### 4. Show, Don't Tell
**Tell stories and give examples instead of making claims.**

❌ Don't say: "Our platform is powerful and easy to use"
✅ Do say: "Yesterday a non-technical founder set this up in 8 minutes. No help needed."

❌ Don't say: "I'm passionate about this problem"
✅ Do say: "I've spent 47 hours this week on this. Missed 2 dinners. Can't stop thinking about it."

## Formatting Rules

### Line Breaks
**Single line break between paragraphs. Never more than 3 lines in a paragraph.**

✅ Good:
```
I thought this would be easy.

Turns out, it's not.

Here's what I learned...
```

❌ Bad:
```
I thought this would be easy. Turns out, it's not. Here's what I learned about the challenges...
```

### Bold Sparingly
**Only bold 1-2 key phrases per message. Don't bold entire sentences.**

✅ Good: "We're launching **Dec 4th** with Scott."
❌ Bad: "**We're launching Dec 4th with Scott.**"

### Bullets Over Paragraphs
**When listing things, always use bullets or numbers.**

✅ Good:
```
Here's what's working:
- Founder OS shipped this weekend
- 7 contexts seeded
- API tested and working
```

❌ Bad:
```
Here's what's working: Founder OS shipped this weekend, we have 7 contexts seeded, and the API is tested and working.
```

### No Jargon
**Replace business-speak with normal words.**

- ❌ "leverage" → ✅ "use"
- ❌ "utilize" → ✅ "use"
- ❌ "bandwidth" → ✅ "time"
- ❌ "circle back" → ✅ "follow up"
- ❌ "synergy" → ✅ delete this word
- ❌ "at scale" → ✅ "for lots of people"

## Template Patterns

### Opening Patterns

**Choose ONE to start your message:**

**O1: The Vulnerable Opening**
```
I used to think [belief].
I was wrong.
```

**O2: The Context-Shift Opening**
```
Everyone's doing [common thing].
We're doing [different thing].
Here's why...
```

**O3: The Contrarian Opening**
```

I disagree.
```

**O4: The Direct Opening**
```
Quick question:
[Your question]

```

```

### Middle Patterns

**M1: Story Arc**
```
Here's what happened:
[Chronological story with specific details]
```

```
I've noticed [pattern].

```

[Specific question]
```

## Proven Blend Recipes

### For Investor Updates
**Opening:** O1 (Vulnerable)
**Middle:** M1 (Story Arc)
**Ending:** E2 (Cliffhanger)

Example:
```
I thought we'd have this demo done a week ago.
We didn't.

Here's what happened:
[Story of what took longer and why]

Demo is now scheduled for Dec 4th with Scott.

More after that meeting.
```

### For Product Launches
**Opening:** O2 (Context-Shift)
**Middle:** M5 (Contrast)
**Ending:** E4 (CTA)

Example:
```
Everyone's building AI to automate your work.

We built one to have better conversations with you.

Most AI tools want to replace you.
Ours wants to understand you.

If you want to try it:
[Link]
```

### For Personal Outreach
**Opening:** O6 (Admission)
**Middle:** M2 (Pattern)
**Ending:** E1 (Invitation)

Example:
```
Haven't talked in 3 weeks.
That's on me.

I've noticed when I get heads-down on a demo,
I lose track of everything else.

This week: happened again.

Want to catch up Friday?
```

### For Team Communication
**Opening:** O4 (Direct)
**Middle:** M3 (Framework)
**Ending:** E5 (Reflection)

Example:
```
Quick question:
How should we prioritize this sprint?

Here's how I think about it:
1. User pain > New features
2. Bugs that block > Bugs that annoy
3. What we promised > What we want

Based on that: fix the auth bug first.

Lessons from last sprint:
- We over-committed
- We under-estimated
- We shipped anyway

Let's not do that again.
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Corporate
```
We are pleased to announce that our platform
has achieved significant milestones...
```

### ✅ More Justin
```
Shipped 3 features this week.
Broke 2 things.
Fixed 1.

Here's what happened...
```

---

### ❌ Too Vague
```
We'll be launching soon with some exciting updates
that our users will love.
```

### ✅ More Justin
```
Launching Dec 4th at 2pm.
3 new features.
Scott and 12 other founders testing.
```

---

### ❌ Too Long
```
I wanted to reach out to provide you with a comprehensive
update on our progress and share some insights I've gained
through this process that I think might be valuable...
```

### ✅ More Justin
```
Quick update:

Demo's ready. Testing Friday. Launching Dec 4th.

Want to see it early?
```

---

### ❌ No Vulnerability
```
We've successfully executed our go-to-market strategy
and exceeded our initial targets.
```

### ✅ More Justin
```
I thought we'd get 10 users.
Got 87.

No idea what I'm doing but it's working.
```

## Voice Checklist

Before sending, check for:

- [ ] **Vulnerability**: Did I share what I got wrong or what surprised me?
- [ ] **Specificity**: Did I use exact dates, numbers, and names?
- [ ] **Conversational**: Does this sound like how I actually talk?
- [ ] **Short paragraphs**: Are all paragraphs 3 lines or less?
- [ ] **Show don't tell**: Did I use stories instead of claims?
- [ ] **No jargon**: Did I replace business-speak with normal words?
- [ ] **Clear next step**: Is it obvious what happens next?

## Examples by Use Case

### Email to Investor

```
Hey Scott,

I thought the demo would be ready last Tuesday.
It wasn't.

Here's what took longer than expected:
- Integration with Supabase took 2 days (thought it'd be 2 hours)
- RLS policies broke 3 times before I figured it out
- Testing revealed 7 edge cases I didn't plan for

Good news: Demo's ready now. Testing it Friday.
Official demo for you: Dec 4th at 2pm.

Still good for that time?

Justin
```

### LinkedIn Post

```
Everyone's building AI agents to replace you.

We built one to understand you.

The difference:

Automation assumes it knows what you need.
Conversation asks.

Founder OS launches this weekend.
It's a Chief of Staff that talks with you, not at you.

More soon.
```

### Team Update

```
Quick wins this week:

- Founder OS schema shipped (7 tables, full RLS)
- Supabase connection tested and working
- API docs written for Claude integration

What's next:

- Seed my real tasks from Google Sheets
- First conversation with Claude using live data
- Integration with Justin's Voice (for desktop)

Blockers:

None. Everything's green.

Ship date: This weekend.
```

### Check-in Message

```
Hey Becky,

Haven't talked in 3 weeks.
That's on me.

Got heads-down on the PowerPak demo and
lost track of everything else.

Still waiting on your proposal feedback.
No pressure if you haven't had time.

Want to catch up this week?

Justin
```

## Using with Founder OS

When combining with Founder OS context, structure your message:

1. **Query Founder OS** for relationship/task/goal context
2. **Use that context** to personalize the message
3. **Apply voice patterns** from this guide

Example flow:
```
Context from Founder OS:
- Relationship: Becky (investor)
- Last contact: Nov 1 (3 weeks ago)
- Sentiment: Concerned
- Task: "Review proposal" (status: blocked, reason: "Waiting for Becky feedback")

Generated message using voice patterns:

Hey Becky,

Realized it's been 3 weeks since we talked about the proposal.

That's on me – got heads-down on the demo.

Quick question: Still good to review it this week?
I'm blocked on next steps until I hear from you.

No pressure if you need more time.
Just want to know what you're thinking.

Justin
```
