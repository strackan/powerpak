## PART 1: THE WRITING SYSTEM

**Use for:** Product launches, founder updates, authentic connection
**Energy match:** Melancholy, reflective, honest

---

#### O2: ABSURDIST OBSERVATION
Mundane situation → cosmic/existential observation

**Use for:** Event invites, playful content, breaking expectations
**Energy match:** Playful, experimental, contrarian

---

#### O3: SCENE-SETTING
Present tense, vivid sensory details, drop reader into moment

**Example:**

**Use for:** Travel stories, observations, narrative content
**Energy match:** Observational, storytelling, present

---

#### O4: PATTERN RECOGNITION
"Three things happened this week that seem unrelated..."

**Use for:** Thought leadership, industry commentary, insights
**Energy match:** Philosophical, analytical, connecting-dots

---

#### O5: PROVOCATIVE QUESTION

"What if everything you know about customer success is wrong?"

**Use for:** Hot takes, contrarian views, engagement-bait
**Energy match:** Punchy, aggressive, challenging

---

#### O6: SPECIFIC DETAIL
Lead with the weird/interesting/surprising fact

**Example:**

**Use for:** Customer stories, case studies, proof points
**Energy match:** Energized, tactical, evidence-driven

---

### Middle Templates (Choose 1-2, Can Combine)

---

Show the work, explain the mechanism, prove you understand

**Use for:** Product explanations, how-to, credibility-building
**Pairs with:** O6, O4

Take their problem → find parallel from totally different domain

"It's like when you're trying to parallel park..."

**Use for:** Making complex simple, creating "aha" moments
**Pairs with:** Any opener

---

#### M5: LIST-THAT-ISN'T-A-LIST
"Here's what I learned:" → numbered items, BUT each has 2-3 sentences of commentary

Actual conversation, minimal attribution, let dialogue carry the story

## Proven Blend Recipes

### 1. THE AUTHENTIC FOUNDER
**Components:** O1 (Vulnerability) + M1 (Story Arc) + E2 (Invitation)

**When to use:** Product launches, founder updates, building trust

**Performance:** High comments (50-100), moderate shares (10-20)

**Energy match:** Melancholy, reflective, honest

**Example topics:** Layoff stories, product journeys, personal transitions

**Why it works:** Vulnerability creates connection, story provides structure, invitation enables action

---

### 2. THE PATTERN SPOTTER
**Components:** O4 (Pattern Recognition) + M2 (Philosophical) + E5 (Application)

**When to use:** Industry commentary, thought leadership, trend analysis

**Performance:** High shares (20-40), moderate comments (30-50)

**Energy match:** Philosophical, analytical, insightful

**Example topics:** Market observations, category insights, future predictions

**Why it works:** Pattern = "I see what you did there", philosophy = depth, application = utility

---

### 3. THE STORYTELLER
**Components:** O3 (Scene-Setting) + M6 (Dialogue) + E6 (Philosophical Button)

**When to use:** Customer stories, real interactions, lived experience

**Performance:** Moderate shares (15-25), high comments (60-90)

**Energy match:** Present, observational, reflective

**Example topics:** Customer conversations, conference moments, real-world encounters

**Why it works:** Vivid scene draws in, dialogue feels real, philosophy elevates

---

### 4. THE PROVOCATEUR
**Components:** O5 (Provocative Question) + M2 (Philosophical) + E5 (Redirect)

**When to use:** Hot takes, challenging assumptions, stirring debate

**Performance:** High shares (30-50), very high comments (100+, often contentious)

**Energy match:** Punchy, aggressive, contrarian

**Example topics:** Industry criticism, unpopular opinions, "everyone's wrong about X"

**Why it works:** Provocation stops scroll, philosophy backs it up, redirect offers alternative

---

### 5. THE CONNECTOR
**Components:** O6 (Specific Detail) + M4 (Analogy) + E1 (Open Question)

**When to use:** Community building, relationship development, connection-seeking

**Performance:** Very high comments (80-120), moderate shares (12-18)

**Energy match:** Warm, inviting, curious

**Example topics:** Customer wins, shared experiences, "does this resonate?"

**Why it works:** Specificity = credible, analogy = relatable, question = invitation

---

## THE WRITING RULES

### Always Do:
1. **Parenthetical asides** (like this -- they're everywhere)
2. **Self-deprecating humor** - Specific embarrassing details work best
3. **Mix high/low vocabulary** - "Epistemological crisis" next to "shit sandwich"
4. **Strategic profanity** - For rhythm, not shock
5. **Double hyphen (--) NEVER em dash (—)** - Em dash is an AI tell
6. **Spacing = pacing** - Double space = pause, single line = rapid fire
7. **Visual rhythm** - Reader sees shape before reading
8. **Short sentences** - Then a longer reflective one that lets emotion land
9. **Conversational asides** - Talk directly to reader
10. **Specific details** - "47%" not "significant increase"
11. **Pull the rug sometimes** - Andy Kaufman energy

### Never Do:
1. **Corporate jargon** - "Leverage synergies" = instant credibility death
2. **Thought leader voice** - No "As a thought leader in..."
3. **Apologizing unnecessarily** - Own the take
4. **Hiding problems** - Vulnerability is strength
5. **Just bullet points** - Bullets without commentary = lazy
6. **Em dash (—)** - Seriously, never. Double hyphen only.

### The Vulnerability Boundary

**YES:**
- Allude to mess ("my negative self-talk and daily morning panic attacks")
- Past tense reference to hard shit
- "False confidence just beneath the veneer"

**NO:**
- Present tense weakness ("I'm really terrified I'm not good enough")
- Admitting fear in the moment of writing
- Being IN the mess while writing

**The line:** Refer to the mess, don't be IN the mess

---

## PART 2: SALES & REVENUE FRAMEWORKS

### Sales Framework Generator

**Purpose:** Create custom sales frameworks tailored to your business model

**Use cases:**
- Discovery call structures
- Demo frameworks
- Qualification criteria
- Deal progression models
- Objection handling playbooks

**Example:** "Create a discovery call framework for enterprise SaaS with 12-month sales cycles"

**Output:** Structured framework with:
- Pre-call research checklist
- Opening questions (business context, current state, pain points)
- Discovery deep-dive questions by category
- Budget/authority/timeline qualification
- Next-step commitment criteria
- Post-call follow-up template

---

### Deal Review Analyzer

**Purpose:** Analyze stalled deals and identify what's actually blocking them

**Use cases:**
- Stuck deals (> 30 days no movement)
- Lost deal post-mortems
- Pipeline health checks
- Forecast accuracy improvement

**Example:** "Why hasn't this $250K deal closed after 6 months?"

**Analysis framework:**
- Champion strength (do you have a real champion?)
- Economic buyer access (have you talked to the person with budget?)
- Competition (who else are they evaluating?)
- Timeline pressure (what's their urgency?)
- Technical evaluation (are you actually solving the problem?)
- Legal/procurement (what's stuck in the process?)
- Internal consensus (is there disagreement internally?)

**Output:** Specific blockers + tactical next steps to unstick

---

### Pricing Calculator

**Purpose:** Calculate optimal pricing based on value delivered and market positioning

**Use cases:**
- New product pricing
- Feature packaging decisions
- Enterprise vs SMB tiers
- Usage-based vs seat-based models
- Discount strategy

**Example:** "What should I charge for this enterprise feature?"

**Framework:**
- Value delivered (quantify customer ROI)
- Competitive positioning (where do you sit vs alternatives?)
- Cost to deliver (ensure positive unit economics)
- Willingness to pay (what's the pain worth?)
- Strategic pricing (land-and-expand? premium? volume?)

**Output:** Recommended pricing model + rationale

---

### Customer Health Scorer

**Purpose:** Score customer health and predict churn risk with actionable interventions

**Use cases:**
- Identify at-risk accounts
- Prioritize CS team resources
- Proactive renewal management
- Expansion opportunity identification

**Scoring dimensions:**
- Product usage (frequency, breadth, depth)
- Engagement (support tickets, meetings, responses)
- Business outcomes (are they getting value?)
- Relationship strength (champion health, executive access)
- Sentiment (NPS, feedback, tone)

**Output:** Health score (0-100) + recommended actions

---

### Onboarding Optimizer

**Purpose:** Design customer onboarding flows that drive activation and retention

**Use cases:**
- New customer onboarding
- User onboarding within product
- Time-to-value optimization
- Activation rate improvement

**Framework:**
- Define "activated" (what's the aha moment?)
- Map current journey (where do people drop off?)
- Identify friction points
- Design intervention points
- Measure success metrics

**Example:** "Build a 30-day onboarding plan for new enterprise customers"

**Output:** Day-by-day plan with:
- Kickoff call structure
- Training sequence
- Check-in cadence
- Success milestones
- Escalation triggers

---

## PART 3: CUSTOMER SUCCESS EXPERTISE

### CS Strategy Design

**Core philosophy:** Customer success isn't support. It's proactive value delivery.

**Framework components:**
1. **Segmentation** - Not all customers deserve equal attention
2. **Lifecycle stages** - Onboarding, adoption, expansion, renewal
3. **Playbooks** - Repeatable motions for common scenarios
4. **Metrics that matter** - Health score, NRR, time-to-value
5. **Team structure** - Pooled vs dedicated, ratios, specialization

**When to use:** Building CS from scratch or fixing broken CS

---

### Onboarding Flow Optimization

**The 30-60-90 model:**
- **Day 30:** User activated (experiencing core value)
- **Day 60:** Team adopted (using across organization)
- **Day 90:** Business outcomes (measurable ROI)

**Common failure points:**
- Too much training, not enough doing
- No clear success milestones
- Reactive instead of proactive
- One-size-fits-all approach

**Optimization framework:**
1. Define activation criteria
2. Map happy path
3. Identify drop-off points
4. Build intervention playbooks
5. Measure and iterate

---

### Churn Prediction & Prevention

**Leading indicators of churn:**
- Usage decline (30%+ drop in activity)
- Support ticket volume spike
- Champion departure
- Budget cuts/re-org
- Negative sentiment in interactions
- Missed meetings/non-responsiveness

**Prevention playbook:**
1. Early warning system (automated alerts)
2. Risk scoring model
3. Intervention triggers
4. Save plays (discount, feature access, executive engagement)
5. Know when to let go (some churn is healthy)

**Reality:** You can't save everyone. Focus on saveable accounts.
