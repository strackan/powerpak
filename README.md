# GTM.Consulting - Text Adventure Transformation

A creative marketing experiment transforming a professional consulting website into a "Where the Wild Things Are" style text-based adventure game.

## Project Overview

**Timeline:** 10 business days (targeting Dec 4, 2024)
**Strategy:** Build in public on LinkedIn as a marketing play
**Tech Stack:** Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks, no build process)

This project transforms gtm.consulting from a traditional B2B consulting site into an interactive text adventure game, demonstrating creativity, technical skill, and strategic thinking in the process.

## Current Status

**Phase:** Clean Static Site (v0.1)
**Next:** Video animation system with "living paintings" effect

## Development Approach

1. **Conversational Design:** Ask questions, show options, get approval before building
2. **Git Discipline:** Clear commits with descriptive messages, tagged phases
3. **Progressive Enhancement:** Each phase adds new features while maintaining previous functionality
4. **Build in Public:** Document and share progress on LinkedIn

## Running Locally

This is a static site with no build process:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. That's it!

For development with live reload, use any static server:
```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx serve

# VS Code
# Use the Live Server extension
```

## Deployment

Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting:

**Vercel:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

**Netlify:**
```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir .
```
