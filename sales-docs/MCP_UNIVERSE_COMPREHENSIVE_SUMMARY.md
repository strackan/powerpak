# MCP Universe: Comprehensive Summary
## Synthesized from 8000+ lines of conversation with Scott Leese

**Document Date:** November 17, 2025  
**Meeting Date:** December 4, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-launch planning phase

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Big Idea:** Build an "AI-native LinkedIn" using Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the foundational technology, creating a searchable universe where people can install each other's knowledge, expertise, and personality as "power packs" for their AI assistants.

**The Bet:** MCP will become the lingua franca of AI communication (like HTTP became for the internet), and whoever builds the first consumer/B2B network effect wins the category.

**Current State:** Justin has built a working proof-of-concept - his own voice extracted into an API that can generate content in his style. The next phase is converting this to an MCP server and building the platform infrastructure.

**Key Players:**
- **Justin Strackany** - Founder, technical architect, proof-of-concept builder
- **Scott Leese** - Potential co-founder/partner, sales leader with massive network in CS/sales space
- **Target:** CS professionals, sales leaders, influencers, then B2B teams

## THE CORE TECHNOLOGY: What Justin Built

### Phase 1: Voice Extraction (COMPLETED)
Justin created a system that:
1. Ingested everything he's ever written (public + private)
2. Analyzed personality tests, 360 reviews, conversation patterns
3. Extracted his "voice" into:
   - 11 distinct beginning styles
   - 7 distinct middle styles  
   - 12 distinct signature endings
4. Built "blends" showing which templates pair together based on mood/context
5. Created embedded instructions for AI to emulate his voice at 91% accuracy
6. Added management instructions (e.g., how to handle "justin disregulated")

### Phase 2: API Conversion (COMPLETED)
Turned the voice system into an API:
- Endpoint: `killer.tools/talk-like-justin?message={content}&tone={business/casual}&platform={LinkedIn/Twitter}`
- Use case: Outsourced "essential Justin-ness" to his DevCommX team
- Enables programmatic content generation in his authentic voice

### Phase 3: MCP Server (NEXT - TARGET: THANKSGIVING)
Convert the API into a Model Context Protocol server:
- Makes Justin's knowledge/voice "installable" by other AI users
- Grants granular access control (friends see X, therapist sees Y, business contacts see Z)
- Enables custom "tools" (HIRE_JUSTIN, MEET_JUSTIN, etc.)
- Creates foundation for the broader MCP Universe platform

## INCONSISTENCIES & CONTRADICTIONS FOUND

### 1. Pricing Model Variations

**Contradiction:**
- Early conversations: Enhanced profile at $299-$999 one-time
- Later conversations: Enhanced profile at $49/month
- Some threads: No Enhanced tier at all, just Basic (free) and Premium ($25K)

**Recommendation:** 
Standardize on the subscription model ($49/mo Enhanced) because:
- Recurring revenue is more predictable
- Lower barrier to entry
- Easier to upsell to Premium later
- Better aligns with SaaS norms

### 2. Scott's Role Ambiguity

**Contradiction:**
- Some threads position Scott as co-founder with significant equity
- Other threads treat him as first premium customer + advisor
- Unclear if he's being asked to invest time, money, or both

**Recommendation:**
Be explicit in Dec 4 meeting about what you're offering:
- If you want a co-founder, say so upfront
- If you want a showcase customer + advisor, be clear about time commitment
- Don't leave it vague or you'll both have different expectations

### 3. Timeline Compression Issues

**Contradiction:**
- "90-day sprint to launch" in some threads
- "Thanksgiving deadline for MCP conversion" (2 weeks)
- "Full extraction takes 40+ hours per person" (can't do 20 in 90 days)

**Recommendation:**
Acknowledge the timeline is aggressive and build in buffers:
- Week 1-2: MCP core (achievable)
- Week 3-4: Scott extraction (doable but tight)
- Week 5-12: Influencer recruitment (more realistic as "enhanced" not "full extraction")
- Week 13+: B2B pilots (probably slips to Month 4-5)

### 4. Technical Feasibility Questions

**Contradiction:**
- MCP is described as both "ready to use" and "still being defined by Anthropic"
- Some threads assume MCP will have native search/discovery built-in
- Others acknowledge you'll need to build all infrastructure yourself

**Recommendation:**
Clarify what's actually possible with MCP today vs. future vision:
- MCP servers can be installed and used NOW
- Search/discovery/marketplace is something YOU need to build
- Position this as "building the first MCP social network" not "using MCP's built-in network"

### 5. Revenue Assumptions

**Contradiction:**
- B2B pilots priced at $10K in some threads, $50K in others
- Premium extraction sometimes $25K, sometimes $15K for "friends and family"
- Unclear if pilot pricing is meant to convert to enterprise deals

**Recommendation:**
Create clear pricing tiers with explicit conversion paths:
- Pilot: $10K for 6 months (proof of concept, converts to $50K+ annual)
- Enterprise: $50K+ annually (full deployment)
- Premium Individual: $25K (standard), $15K (early adopters/referrals)

## KEY RISKS & MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Risk 1: MCP Protocol Adoption
**Risk:** What if MCP doesn't become the standard? What if Anthropic changes the spec?

**Mitigation:**
- Build on open protocols where possible
- Create abstraction layer (could pivot to OpenAI's protocol or others)
- Focus on the VALUE (searchable expertise network) not just the TECH (MCP)
- Have fallback: Even if MCP fails, you've built "LinkedIn for AI" which has standalone value

### Risk 2: Chicken-and-Egg (Network Effects)
**Risk:** No one installs profiles because there aren't enough profiles. No one creates profiles because no one's installing.

**Mitigation:**
- Start with tight, valuable network (CS/sales leaders)
- Make profiles useful even before installation (public search, traditional web pages)
- Focus on B2B use case first (teams have built-in network effect)
- Seed with high-quality showcases (Scott, other influencers)

### Risk 3: Justin's Time Constraints
**Risk:** You're already running Renubu full-time. Adding MCP Universe is a second company.

**Mitigation:**
- Clarify what you're actually building: Is this Renubu pivot? Parallel company? Side project?
- If parallel: Need to hire for one or both companies
- If pivot: Need to wind down Renubu or find someone to run it
- Be realistic about time: Can't do two startups simultaneously

### Risk 4: Premium Extraction Doesn't Scale
**Risk:** If each Premium MCP takes 40 hours of YOUR time, you can only do 50/year max (at 2000 hours/year)

**Mitigation:**
- Premium is aspirational, not volume play (20/year @ $25K = $500K revenue from just YOU)
- Build AI-assisted extraction tools to reduce your time (40 hours → 10 hours)
- Eventually train others to do extractions (franchising the process)
- Focus volume growth on Enhanced tier (scalable, AI-assisted)

### Risk 5: Privacy and Data Security
**Risk:** You're asking people to share deeply personal content (writings, voice, personality)

**Mitigation:**
- Build security/privacy from day one (not an afterthought)
- Clear data policies: Who owns what, how it's used, can you delete
- Granular permissions system (this was in your vision already)
- Compliance with data regulations (GDPR, etc.)
- Insurance for data breaches

---

## RECOMMENDED ADJUSTMENTS

### 1. Clarify the Renubu Relationship

**Question:** Is MCP Universe:
A) A feature of Renubu (CS teams use it for knowledge sharing)?
B) A separate company that Justin runs alongside Renubu?
C) A pivot away from Renubu entirely?

**My Take:** It sounds like Option B, but that's not sustainable. You need to pick one or find a way to merge them. 

**Possible Synthesis:**
- Renubu becomes the B2B application layer for MCP Universe
- MCP Universe is the infrastructure (profile/network)
- Renubu is the "use case" (CS workflow automation powered by MCP)
- You're essentially building the rails (MCP) and the train (Renubu) simultaneously

### 2. Start Smaller, Think Bigger

**Current Plan:** 90-day sprint to full platform launch

**Recommended:** 90-day sprint to PROTOTYPE and validate, 12-month plan to scale

**Adjusted Timeline:**
- Month 1: Build MCP core, create Scott showcase
- Month 2: Get 5-10 pilot users (not 20), gather feedback
- Month 3: Refine product based on learnings
- Month 4-6: Broader influencer recruitment (now you know what works)
- Month 7-12: B2B push, enterprise features, scale infrastructure

**Why:** You're trying to do too much too fast. Better to have 10 incredibly happy users than 20 lukewarm ones.

### 3. Define Success Metrics for Dec 4

**Goal:** By end of meeting, you should know:
- Is Scott in or out? (And if in, at what level?)
- What are the next 3 action items?
- What's the timeline for decision-making?

**Questions to Answer:**
- Do we build this together or am I building it and you're advising?
- What's your time commitment? (Hours per week)
- What's the equity/comp structure?
- Who else should we talk to? (Intros, validation)
- What would need to be true for you to go all-in on this?

### 4. Build in Public (Selectively)

**Current Approach:** Seems mostly private/stealth until launch

**Recommended:** Share the journey with a small, engaged audience

**Why:**
- Builds anticipation and FOMO
- Gets feedback early (cheaper to pivot)
- Creates content for marketing later
- Validates (or invalidates) assumptions quickly

**How:**
- Weekly updates to a small email list (100-500 people)
- Behind-the-scenes content on LinkedIn (Justin's authentic voice)
- "Building in public" thread as you code/design
- Early access waitlist to gauge interest

## QUESTIONS FOR YOU (Justin)

### Strategic Questions

1. **Renubu vs. MCP Universe:** Are these one company or two? If two, which one are you prioritizing?

2. **Scott's Role:** What are you actually offering him? Co-founder equity, advisor equity, or showcase customer?

3. **Timeline Realism:** Is 90 days to launch realistic given you're also running Renubu and have family commitments?

4. **Funding Strategy:** Bootstrapped or raising? If raising, when and how much?

### Technical Questions

5. **MCP Maturity:** How stable is the MCP protocol? Are there production examples beyond toys?

6. **Voice Extraction Scale:** Can you really do 20 extractions in 90 days, or is that aspirational?

7. **Search Infrastructure:** Are you building search from scratch or using existing tools (Algolia, etc.)?

### Business Model Questions

8. **B2B Focus:** Are you B2C (individual profiles), B2B (team licenses), or both? Which is primary?

9. **Pricing Flexibility:** Are you open to adjusting pricing based on Dec 4 feedback, or is this locked in?

10. **Competitive Landscape:** Who else is building in this space? Have you researched competitors?

## FINAL THOUGHTS

### What's Actually Brilliant About This

1. **Timing:** MCP is new enough that you could define the space
2. **Proof of Concept:** You've already built your own extraction (de-risks tech)
3. **Network Effects:** If you get the right 20 people, they bring the next 200
4. **Monetization:** Multiple revenue streams (individual, B2B, enterprise)
5. **Vision:** This could genuinely be "LinkedIn for AI" if MCP takes off

### What Concerns Me

1. **Scope Creep:** You're trying to build too much too fast
2. **Two Startups:** Running Renubu + MCP simultaneously is unsustainable
3. **Timeline Pressure:** 90 days to launch is aggressive; don't sacrifice quality
4. **Scott's Role:** Need clarity on what you're asking vs. what he wants
5. **Technical Risk:** MCP protocol is still evolving; Anthropic could change it

### The Bottom Line

**This is a legitimately big idea.** The concept of turning people into "installable" AI power packs is novel, timely, and could create genuine value. The MCP protocol gives you a technical foundation that didn't exist 6 months ago.

**But execution will be everything.** You need to:
- Nail the demo for Scott (make him FEEL the magic)
- Be realistic about timelines (under-promise, over-deliver)
- Focus on the smallest possible MVP that validates the concept
- Get clarity on Renubu relationship (pivot, parallel, or integrate)
- Build something people actually want to install and use (not just cool tech)

**My recommendation:** Go into the Dec 4 meeting with confidence, but also humility. Show Scott what's possible, get his honest feedback, and be open to pivoting based on what you learn. This is a discovery conversation, not a pitch. You're figuring it out together.
