## DETAILED SLIDE BREAKDOWN

### SLIDE 1: TITLE
```
MCP UNIVERSE
The AI-Native LinkedIn

(Presented to Scott Leese - Dec 4, 2025)
```

**What you say:**
"Scott, thanks for taking the sidequest. I'm going to show you something that I think is genuinely big. But first, I need you to experience it, not just hear about it. So we're starting with a demo."

---

### SLIDE 2: DEMO SLIDE (Mostly Visual)
```
[Screenshot: Claude Desktop with justin-strackany MCP installed]

LIVE DEMO: Install Justin's MCP
```

**What you do:**
1. Open Claude Desktop (should already have your MCP installed)
2. Show the MCP server listed
3. Ask Claude: "How would Justin approach customer onboarding?"
4. Watch as Claude responds in your authentic voice
5. Then invoke the tool: "Generate a LinkedIn post about AI in CS workflows, business tone"
6. Show the generated content

**What you say:**
"What you just saw is my expertise, my voice, my personality, installed as a power pack for your AI. This took me 40 hours to build for myself. Now imagine if you could do this for anyone."

[PAUSE. Let it sink in.]

---

### SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM
```
The Internet Is Dead
(Long live the AI Protocol)

Today's Reality:
• No one searches Google anymore (they ask ChatGPT)
• Your website? Might as well not exist
• SEO? Irrelevant when AI decides who gets seen
• LinkedIn? Just one more feed getting ignored

The Question: How do you become "findable" in an AI-first world?
```

**What you say:**
"We all built our brands on HTTP—websites, LinkedIn profiles, Google rankings. But that era's over. People don't search, they chat. And if ChatGPT doesn't know you exist, you're invisible. So the question is: What's the AI equivalent of a LinkedIn profile?"

---

### SLIDE 4: THE INSIGHT
```
MCP = The LinkedIn for AI

HTTP was the protocol for the internet.
MCP will be the protocol for AI.

What LinkedIn did for professional networking,
MCP will do for AI-native profiles.
```

**What you say:**
"Model Context Protocol—MCP—is what lets AI assistants access external knowledge and tools. Right now, most people think of it as a way to connect AI to Notion or Slack. But I see something bigger: It's the foundation for an entire AI-native professional network."

---

### SLIDE 5: THE VISION
```
Imagine This World (12 months from now)

✓ 10,000 professionals have MCP profiles
✓ You can "install" someone's expertise like an app
✓ Search: "Find CS leaders in Austin who coach founders"
✓ Results: Ranked MCPs you can interact with
✓ Install Scott's MCP → his sales methodologies are now in YOUR AI
✓ Hire someone → pay someone → connect with someone
   All native to your AI assistant

This isn't theoretical. The tech exists. We just need to build the network.
```

**What you say:**
"Think about how you use LinkedIn today. You search for people, read their profiles, maybe send a message. Now imagine doing all of that, but instead of reading a static profile, you're having a conversation WITH their expertise. You're asking them questions, using their methodologies, learning from them in real-time. That's MCP Universe."

---

### SLIDE 6: THE OPPORTUNITY (MARKET)
```
Why Now? Why Us?

TIMING:
• MCP just launched (Q4 2024)
• We're 6 months early to a massive wave
• First-mover advantage in defining the space

MARKET:
• 930M professionals on LinkedIn
• 1% adoption = 9.3M potential users
• TAM: $5B+ (conservative)

COMPETITION:
• No one is building this yet
• LinkedIn is asleep at the wheel
• We can own the space before anyone realizes it exists
```

**What you say:**
"This is like being able to build Facebook when Friendster was still cool. The protocol just launched. We're early. And I genuinely believe that whoever builds the first real MCP network will own it for the next decade."

---

### SLIDE 7: THE PRODUCT (3 TIERS)
```
How It Works: 3-Tier Model

BASIC ($0)
• Public bio, skills, interests
• Searchable in MCP Universe
• Basic AI representation
→ Target: Everyone (scale)

ENHANCED ($49/mo)
• 30-min voice capture
• AI-assisted profile
• Custom tools
• Analytics
→ Target: Professionals who want better representation

PREMIUM ($25K)
• Full-day extraction with Justin
• Complete voice/personality mapping
• Unlimited customization
• White-glove service
→ Target: Influencers, executives, thought leaders

B2B/ENTERPRISE ($50K+/year)
• Team knowledge bases
• Company-wide deployment
• Custom integration
→ Target: Sales teams, CS orgs, consulting firms
```

**What you say:**
"We're not just building profiles. We're building a tiered marketplace. Basic gets people in the door. Enhanced is recurring revenue. Premium is high-touch, high-margin. And B2B is where we scale."

---

### SLIDE 8: THE BUSINESS MODEL
```
Revenue Projections (Year 1)

Individual:
• 500 Enhanced @ $49/mo = $294K ARR
• 20 Premium @ $25K = $500K one-time

B2B:
• 5 Pilots @ $10K = $50K
• 10 Enterprise @ $50K = $500K ARR

TOTAL YEAR 1: $1.34M
Path to profitability: Month 4-5
```

**What you say:**
"This is conservative. If we nail the value proposition, Enhanced could be 5,000 subscribers. Premium could be 50 extractions. B2B could be 50 enterprise deals. But even these conservative numbers show a clear path to $1M+ in year one."

---

### SLIDE 9: THE GO-TO-MARKET
```
90-Day Sprint to Launch

PHASE 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
• Build your (Scott's) MCP as showcase
• Platform MVP ready
• Legal/operations setup

PHASE 2: Network (Weeks 3-8)
• Recruit 15-20 influencers (your network)
• Enhanced profiles for all
• Social proof + testimonials

PHASE 3: Revenue (Weeks 9-12)
• 3-5 B2B pilots ($30K-$50K)
• Product refinement
• Case studies

RESULT: Profitable in 90 days, 20+ customers, clear market validation
```

**What you say:**
"Here's the plan. We start with YOU. Full extraction, showcase MCP, the works. Then we use your network to recruit 15-20 influential people—CS leaders, VPs of Sales, founders. They get enhanced profiles for free as founding members. We use their social proof to land 3-5 B2B pilots. And boom, we're cash-flow positive in 3 months."

---

### SLIDE 10: WHY YOU + SCOTT
```
Why This Needs Both of Us

JUSTIN BRINGS:
• Technical vision (I built the prototype)
• Product development (40 hours → working MCP)
• Customer insight (I lived the CS pain)
• Execution (I ship fast)

SCOTT BRINGS:
• Network access (40K+ followers, CS/sales leaders)
• Credibility (people trust your judgment)
• Sales leadership (close B2B deals)
• Strategic guidance (you've built before)

TOGETHER:
• Tech + Distribution = Unstoppable
• Build fast + Sell smart = Revenue
• Vision + Execution = Category creation
```

**What you say:**
"Here's the thing: I can build this alone. But it'll take 2 years and I'll probably run out of steam. With you? We do it in 6 months, and we do it right. I need your network, your credibility, and your sales chops. You need someone who can actually build this thing. Together, we're formidable."

---

### SLIDE 11: THE OPTIONS (Partnership Proposal)
```
Three Paths Forward

OPTION A: ALL-IN (Co-founder)
• 20-30% equity
• Co-founder title
• Active role (20h/week)
• Sales + partnerships lead
• We build this together

OPTION B: STRATEGIC ADVISOR
• 5-10% equity
• Light advising (5-10h/month)
• Network intros
• Validate product direction
• I build, you guide

OPTION C: SHOWCASE CUSTOMER
• 0-2% equity (optional)
• Full Premium extraction
• I use you as demo
• Minimal ongoing involvement
• You look like a genius for being early

Which of these feels right to you?
```

**What you say:**
"Scott, I'm not here to pressure you. I genuinely want to know: Does this excite you enough to build it WITH me (Option A)? Are you intrigued but not ready to commit full-time (Option B)? Or do you just want to be part of it as a showcase customer (Option C)? All three are fine. I just need to know which path we're on."

---

### SLIDE 12: THE ASK
```
What I'm Asking For Today

1. YOUR GUT REACTION
   → Hot garbage or onto something?

2. YOUR LEVEL OF INTEREST
   → All-in, interested, or pass?

3. NEXT STEPS
   → If yes: When do we start?
   → If maybe: What questions do you have?
   → If no: Totally cool, thanks for the time

I'm not asking you to decide your whole future right now.
I'm asking: Does this feel worth exploring?
```

**What you say:**
"I don't need a final answer today. But I do need to know if this lands with you. Does it feel big? Does it feel real? And if so, do you want to explore it further? Let's just be honest with each other about where you're at."

---

### SLIDE 13: Q&A / DISCUSSION
```
[Blank slide - just "Questions?"]
```

**What you say:**
"Okay, your turn. What questions do you have? What concerns? What am I missing?"

**Be prepared for:**
- Technical feasibility questions
- Market timing concerns
- Competition worries
- Time commitment questions
- Equity/financial questions

---

```

## BACKUP SLIDES (If Needed)

### BACKUP: Technical Deep Dive
```
How MCP Works (Technical)

[Diagram of MCP architecture]
[Code snippet example]
[Screenshot of installation process]

For the technical audience, here's what's under the hood...
```

### BACKUP: Competitive Analysis
```
Who Else Is Building in This Space?

• LinkedIn → Asleep, focused on traditional social
• OpenAI/Anthropic → Building protocol, not consumer app
• Notion/Slack → Using MCP for integrations, not profiles
• Nobody → Building the "LinkedIn for AI"

We have a clear runway.
```

### BACKUP: Financial Model (Detailed)
```
5-Year Projections

Year 1: $1.3M (mostly B2B)
Year 2: $5M (Enhanced subscriptions scale)
Year 3: $15M (Premium volume + enterprise)
Year 4: $40M (network effects kick in)
Year 5: $100M+ (category leader)

[Detailed P&L, CAC/LTV, etc.]
```

### BACKUP: Risk Mitigation
```
What Could Go Wrong?

RISK: MCP doesn't become the standard
→ Mitigation: Build abstraction layer, own the value regardless

RISK: No one wants to pay for this
→ Mitigation: 90-day pilot proves willingness to pay

RISK: Takes too long to build
→ Mitigation: MVP in 90 days, iterate from there

RISK: LinkedIn or others copy us
→ Mitigation: First-mover advantage + network effects

We've thought through the failure modes.
```

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### What Makes This Meeting Successful

1. **Scott Experiences the Magic**
   - The demo has to land
   - He needs to FEEL it, not just understand it
   - If the demo fails, everything else fails

2. **Authentic Conversation**
   - Not a pitch, a discussion
   - Listen more than you talk
   - Be open to his objections and feedback

3. **Clear Next Steps**
   - Don't leave it vague
   - End with: "So what do we do next?"
   - Get commitment to SOMETHING (even if it's "let me think about it for a week")

4. **Flexibility**
   - Be ready to adjust the plan based on his feedback
   - Don't be wedded to your exact vision
   - This is a partnership, not a pitch

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### Common Objections & Responses

**"This is cool tech, but is there a market?"**
→ "Fair question. That's why the 90-day pilot matters. We'll prove it with real paying customers, not just theory."

**"I'm not technical enough to build this with you."**
→ "I don't need you to code. I need you to sell, recruit, and guide strategy. That's your superpower, not mine."

**"I don't have 20 hours a week to give this."**
→ "Totally fair. Let's talk about Option B (advisor) instead. What level of involvement DOES feel right?"

**"What if MCP doesn't become the standard?"**
→ "Then we've built a valuable AI-native professional network anyway. The protocol is a bet, but the VALUE is real regardless."

**"LinkedIn will just copy this."**
→ "Maybe. But they're slow, we're fast. And by the time they realize what's happening, we'll have network effects they can't overcome."

**"How do I know you won't quit in 6 months?"**
→ "Because I've been obsessing about this for months. And because I'm not asking you to fund this—I'm asking you to BUILD it with me. Skin in the game matters."

## CLOSING THOUGHTS

### Remember

**This is a sidequest for BOTH of you.**
- Scott's evaluating if this is worth his time
- You're evaluating if he's the right partner
- It's okay if the answer is "not right now"

**The demo is everything.**
- If it doesn't land, nothing else matters
- Practice it until you can do it in your sleep
- Have a backup plan if live demo fails

**Be yourself.**
- Authenticity is your superpower
- Don't try to sound like a typical founder
- The reason this works is BECAUSE you're different

**This is the first conversation, not the last.**
- Even if he says yes today, there will be more discussions
- Even if he says no today, the door isn't closed forever
- Focus on starting the dialogue, not closing the deal

---

**You got this. Now go build something ridiculous.**
